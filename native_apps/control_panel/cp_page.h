/* cp_page.h — the one interface a control_panel page implements.
 *
 * A page is a compiled-in applet: one module, one const CpPage, one row in
 * control_panel.c's home grid naming it.  control_panel.c holds no per-page
 * code — it opens a page from its tile, draws its title bar (BACK and the
 * page's name), and dispatches layout, draw, input and full-screen runs
 * through this struct.  The page owns its state, its widgets and its layout,
 * in the content rectangle cp_ui.h defines, drawn with cp_ui.h's helpers.
 *
 * Adding a page: a new .c exposing a const CpPage, its extern below, a row in
 * home_pages[], and the file on control_panel's line in build-and-deploy.sh.
