/* cp_ui.h — what control_panel's page modules share with control_panel.c.
 *
 * control_panel.c owns the page bar and the home grid; every page (led_page.c,
 * monitor_page.c, info_page.c, network_page.c, usb_page.c, input_page.c,
 * audio_page.c, display_page.c, bluetooth_page.c) lays itself out in the same content rectangle
 * and draws with the same helpers.
 * This header is the one home for that rectangle and those helpers, so a moved
 * page cannot carry a second copy of either.  The helper bodies stay in control_panel.c.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from SCREEN_SAFE_*, so it is only correct after
 * fb_init() and touch_init(), and a layout computed from it must be re-run
 * after any fb_set_bezel() — which is what rebuild_ui() is for.
