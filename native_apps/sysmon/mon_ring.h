/* mon_ring.h — the history ring rwmond publishes and the Monitor page reads.
 *
 * Pure: no file or /proc access, so a host test drives it with strings.
 * rwmond.c owns the sampling and the file; monitor_page.c the reading.
 *
 * The published file (MON_RING_PATH) is text, rewritten whole once a second
 * and renamed into place, so a reader sees either the previous or the next
 * version, never a half-written one:
 *
 *   rwmond 1 <wall_cs> <flags> <count>
 *   <cpu_pm> <mem_kb> <temp_mc>        count lines, oldest first
 *
 * wall_cs is /proc/uptime in centiseconds when the file was written, which is
 * what makes freshness checkable without trusting the (unsynced) wall clock.
 * Any field may be "-": no reading (the first second has no CPU share; a
 * kernel without the bandgap driver has no temperature).  flags is a bit set
 * for the daemon's state; bit 0 (MON_FLAG_OVERTEMP) is the over-temperature
 * warning, which framebuffer.c paints as a red square (common/overtemp.h).
