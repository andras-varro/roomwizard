# gen-sounds.sh — rebuild the stock sound effects from fx_gen.c.
#
# ⚠️ **RETIRED, AND IT OVERWRITES THE SHIPPED EFFECTS.** The ten fx_*.wav are SOURCED files now, not this
# generator's output: its gate enforced "broadband and transient", the operator heard the result as white
# noise on the panel and on a PC, and the property that actually matters is energy inside the speaker's
# usable band rather than spectral flatness. Running this replaces every sourced clip with generated noise
# and the loss is silent. See prompts.md for how the shipped set is authored.
#
# HOST ONLY. No device, no cross-compiler, no listen.
#
# ⚠️ **The self-test runs FIRST and a failure stops the script.** Its gate makes
# "broadband and transient" a checked property, and a gate that has only ever been
# seen passing is not evidence (../../CLAUDE.md → *Working style*). If its four
# controls stop coming out 1-pass / 3-reject, nothing it writes can be trusted.
# ⚠️ That gate is also why this script is retired: the checked property was the
# wrong one, so the numbers were green and the sounds were unusable.
#
# fx_gen is deterministic by construction (a fixed xorshift32 seed per effect,
# never rand()), so what it writes is reviewable — but it no longer matches the
# committed .wav files, and a clean `git status` after a run is NOT expected now.
# The effects this script installs are deployed by ../build-and-deploy.sh.
# Run from WSL (this host has no gcc in Git Bash — root ../../CLAUDE.md):
#   wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard/native_apps/sounds && ./gen-sounds.sh"

gen-sounds.sh — rebuild native_apps/sounds/fx_*.wav from fx_gen.c

  ./gen-sounds.sh              build fx_gen, run its gate self-test, regenerate
  ./gen-sounds.sh --check      self-test only; writes nothing, touches no .wav
  ./gen-sounds.sh --help       this text

Output is mono / 44100 / 16-bit — the mix bus's internal format, so nothing at
runtime resamples. Deterministic: re-running with no source change leaves every
file byte-identical.
