# ── Why this is its own file ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The nine manifests used to be nine `cat > … << APP` heredocs inside an
# `ssh "$DEVICE" bash <<'REMOTE'` block in build-and-deploy.sh, i.e. they only
# existed as a side effect of having a reachable device.  The offline installer
# (../IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md F10) has no device and must write byte-identical
# manifests, so a second copy of that heredoc was the obvious move and the wrong
# one: `exec=` paths and `args=` values would drift between the two, and a
# manifest whose `exec=` names a binary that is not there renders a launcher tile
# that does nothing when tapped.
#
# So: the manifests are DATA here, written locally by rw_write_app_manifests, and
# both the deploy path and `--bundle` copy those same files.
#
# ── Format ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#
#     name=Snake
#     exec=/opt/games/snake
#     icon=/opt/roomwizard/icons/snake.ppm
#     args=fb,touch
#
# `args` is one of fb,touch / fb / touch / none — or empty, which device_tools
# uses to say "take no argument at all".
#
# One record per line below: basename|name|exec|icon|args
# The separator is `|` because a display name legitimately contains a space
# ("Brick Breaker", "Office Runner") and must not be split on it.

# rw_write_app_manifests DIR

# Write every manifest above into DIR as <basename>.app.  DIR is created.
# Echoes nothing on success; the caller reports.  Returns non-zero if a manifest
# the table names did not appear — which is also the only way this can report at
# all, for the reason spelled out at sound-sets.sh's rw_write_sound_sets.  It
# counts the TABLE's files, not `*.app`: build/ is never cleaned, so a retired
# manifest left behind by an older checkout must not read as a failure here.
#
# Mode is NOT set here.  /mnt/c is DrvFs and discards chmod (CLAUDE.md), so a
# mode set on this host is unobservable and unreliable; 0644 for these is
# DECLARED in the bundle manifest and applied by whoever installs them.
