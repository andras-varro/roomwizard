/**
 * audio_out — the output device half, and the ONE stream in this repo.
 *
 * The device is opened once, configured once, prefilled with silence and then
 * never reset and never reconfigured until shutdown.  That is the whole point:
 * a click is a stream transition, and every canned sound used to be a full stop
 * and start of the DAI (`audio.c`'s per-sound ring reset).  Native ALSA clicks
 * at a transition too, so no userspace API avoids it — only not stopping the
 * stream does.
 *
 * This is not a design.  `scummvm-roomwizard/backend-files/oss-mixer.cpp` has
 * run exactly this — one open, prefill, deadline pacing, an arithmetic-shift
 * attenuation immediately before `write()`, no reset — on this device since
 * 2026-08-03, and Full Throttle's video, MIDI, speech and effects all play well
 * (operator, 2026-08-18).  This file is that architecture moved into shared
 * code, so there is ONE implementation to maintain when the next emulator port
 * arrives rather than a third copy of open/configure/prefill/pace/attenuate.
 *
 * Everything arithmetic stays in `audio_gen.c` and is unmodified: the lead, the
 * frame counts, the write loop, the mono→interleaved expansion.  What is here is
 * the four things that need a device — configure-and-read-back, how much room the
 * queue has, the write, and the drain — plus the two policies over
 * `audio_write_frames()` that this file's two write modes need.
 *
 * ── ONE `AudioOut` PER PROCESS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ A second concurrent open of the device is refused *Device or resource busy*
 * (measured, ../SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md#34-audio), so `audio_out_open*()` refuses a
 * second LIVE instance itself rather than letting the driver produce a confusing
 * EBUSY halfway through an init.  Sequential open/close pairs are fine, which is
 * what `control_panel` relies on: its one `Audio` is the Audio page's
 * (`control_panel/audio_page.c`), and the page closes it before it launches
 * `audio_mix_test`, which opens its own.
 *
 * ── THE THREADING CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no mutex in here, deliberately, because `native_apps` links no
 * pthread at all — static ARM plus pthread is the `clock_gettime64` →
 * SIGSEGV-before-`main()` scar (../CLAUDE.md) — and a `SCHED_RR` audio thread
 * starves this single 600 MHz core to a black screen.  So:
 *
 *   - `audio_out_open*()`, `audio_out_close()`, `audio_out_set_fill()` and
 *     `audio_out_set_shift()` are for ONE thread, and it must be the same thread
 *     for all of them.
 *   - `audio_out_service()` may run on a DIFFERENT thread from that one (ScummVM
 *     opens on its main thread and services from its audio thread), but only ever
 *     one thread at a time, and never concurrently with `set_fill`/`close`.
 *   - `audio_out_write()` — mode 2 — must run on the servicing thread, or on the
 *     owning thread while nothing is servicing.  It is refused outright while a
 *     fill callback is installed, which is what makes the common case safe by
 *     construction rather than by discipline.
 *   - The fill callback must not call back into any `audio_out_*` function.
 *   - The accessors are reads of one word and safe from anywhere; they are
 *     diagnostics, not synchronisation.
 *
 * ── THE TWO WRITE MODES, AND WHY BOTH ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠️ A service-driven library alone would SILENTLY MUTE two shipped Settings
 * tabs.  `control_panel.c` plays its speaker test tones
 * with **no render loop at all** — init, tone, `usleep`, tone, close — so nothing
 * would ever call `audio_out_service()` and the tones would sit in a callback
 * that is never invoked.  Measured objectively, not inferred.
 *
 *   mode 1, SERVICED    `audio_out_service()` from a render loop or an audio
 *                       thread.  Targets a lead; never sleeps.
 *   mode 2, SYNCHRONOUS `audio_out_write()` pushes a whole buffer with a bounded
 *                       blocking policy.  Costs whole-buffer CPU, which is free
 *                       on a static UI, and the stream still never resets.
 *
 * Both go through the same never-reset stream, and `audio_out_close()` DRAINS in
 * either mode — bounded — or the queued tail is thrown away at exit.

/** What the driver's free-space report over-states the queue by, as a fraction
 *  of one period.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The device's free-space report OVER-STATES what is still queued, and this
 * is measured, not inferred.** On `.188` 2026-08-18 the OSS shim's `GETOSPACE`
 * disagreed with the kernel's own `buffer_size − avail` read at the same instant
 * by 2650–2670 frames on every `RUNNING` sample — ~60 ms at 44100, ~1.3 of the
 * shim's 2048-frame period.  That single number explains the whole interval sweep:
 * a NOMINAL 139 ms lead is ~79 ms of real audio, which is why a 66 ms service
 * interval survives with ~11 ms to spare and a 100 ms one starves ~2.5×/s.
 *
 * It is expressed as a fraction of the PERIOD because periods are the only unit
 * the shim moves in, and its period is 2048 frames at every rate and channel
 * count tested.  ⚠️ The mechanism — how much is the staged period and how much
 * a stale `hw_ptr` — is NOT established, so treat the fraction as the shape of
 * the measurement rather than as a law.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It is deliberately NOT subtracted from the in-flight figure.** Subtracting
 * it would make the library write more, deepening the queue and the onset latency
 * to fix a starvation the measurement says does not happen at the cadence the
 * library asks for.  It is used in exactly two places, both of which would
 * otherwise be a nominal number presented as audio: the service-interval ceiling
 * below, and the close-time drain's stop condition.  */

 *
 * ⚠️ **"Shown" is display only, and the saved choice is never rewritten by it.**
 * A saved "usb" with no DAC already plays onboard and moves to the DAC when it
 * returns (`audio_out_usb_returned()`); the page shows AUTO meanwhile because
 * that is what is happening, but persisting AUTO would silently lose the
