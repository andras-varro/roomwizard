/**
 * audio_gen — the audio logic that has no device in it.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of its arguments: no fd, no ioctl, no
 * clock, no sysfs.  That is the whole point — it is the half of `audio.c` a
 * host regression can reach (`tests/audio_gen_test.c`), and the half that must
 * survive the OSS → ALSA port unchanged (../IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md F1).
 *
 * The device half — open/configure/write/close plus the GPIO12 amp poke —
 * stays in `audio.c` and moves to `audio_dev.c` when it becomes tinyalsa.
 *
 * Two rules this file exists to enforce:
 *
 *   1. THE CHANNEL COUNT IS AN ARGUMENT, never a literal.  The device grants it
 *      (`hw:0,0` grants exactly 2 — measured, ../SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md#34-audio);
 *      a caller that assumes is only accidentally right.  Every byte count here
 *      derives from a channel count handed in.
 *   2. A WRITE NEVER STOPS MID-FRAME.  The generator is mono and the device is
 *      interleaved stereo, so half a frame handed to the kernel swaps L and R
 *      for the rest of the stream — permanently, with no mono path underneath
 *      to absorb it.  `audio_write_frames()` is the only place that decides
 *      when to stop, and it stops on frame boundaries or says it could not.
