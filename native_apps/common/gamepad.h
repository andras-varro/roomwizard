/**
 * Gamepad Input Module for RoomWizard
 *
 * Reusable input abstraction that merges gamepad (Xbox 360 via evdev),
 * keyboard, mouse, and touch into a unified API.  Used by all native games.
 *
 * Hardware: TI AM335x, Linux 4.14.52, evdev input subsystem.
 *
 * Mouse support added for USB mice — provides absolute cursor position
 * updated from relative movements, with configurable acceleration.
 *
 * Gamepad button mapping allows remapping evdev codes for clone controllers.
 *
 * Configuration persistence via /etc/input_config.conf (key=value format).
