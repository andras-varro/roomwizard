/* ── The device half, and nothing else ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every frame count, byte count, envelope and write decision in here comes from
 * `audio_gen.c`, which has no device in it and is host-tested.  What is left is
 * the four things that genuinely need a device — configure-and-read-back, how
 * much room the queue has, the write, and the drain — behind a vtable so a host
 * regression can drive all of it with no fd.
 *
 * ⚠️ **There is no ring-reset ioctl anywhere below this line, and that is the
 * fix.** The steady-state count must be exactly zero, which is a grep-checkable
 * number rather than a rule to remember; the pattern is in
 * `tests/audio_out_test.c`'s header, written so that it cannot match its own
 * documentation.
 */

/* ── Write policies: two, over the one loop in audio_gen.c ───────────────────
 *
 * `audio_write_frames()` is still the only code that decides when to stop, and it
 * stops on a frame boundary or reports that it could not.  These are POLICIES over
 * it, not loops — the rule that four hand-rolled EAGAIN loops were collapsed into
 * (`native_apps/CLAUDE.md`), and it now has to hold across this library's clients
 * as well as inside one directory, or an emulator port satisfies it while adding
 * two loops in a second file.
 */

/** ⚠️ **The prefill BLOCKS and must still be BOUNDED.** It is the one call in
 *  this file allowed to sleep, and an unlimited `max_waits` against a device that
 *  will not take the prefill hangs `audio_out_open()` forever — measured, by
 *  `tests/audio_out_test.c` group D hanging the suite the first time it drove a
 *  device with a byte budget.  So its bound is derived per call from the length
 *  of what it is writing, exactly like mode 2's: see `blocking_policy()`. */

/** ⚠️ **The serviced policy's wait is 0, and that is load-bearing.** It is called
 *  from a render loop or an audio thread that believes the call is free, so it may
 *  not block — and `stop_on_again` alone does not achieve that: mid-frame
 *  `audio_write_frames()` ignores the stop condition and waits up to
 *  AUDIO_ALIGN_TRIES times, which at a 1000 µs interval is 4 ms of sleep inside a
 *  function documented as never sleeping.  `dsp_wait`-style waits already no-op at
