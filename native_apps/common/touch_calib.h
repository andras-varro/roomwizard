/* Shared calibration measurement — the raw→PANEL fit and everything that
 * judges it.
 *
 * This module exists because the fit used to exist twice, independently
 * (device_tools' Calibration tab and tests/unified_calibrate.c), and both
 * copies carried the same defect: crosshairs inset only 40 px, i.e. inside the
 * band where raw compresses. The fit slope came out shallow, extrapolated
 * outside 0..4095, and invented a horizontal inset that does not exist. It took
 * a separate tool (touch_raw) and a day of measurement to work that out, so the
 * fit now lives in exactly one place and every caller uses it.
 *
 * Two rules the callers must not break:
 *   - fit against PANEL coordinates, never logical ones. Stage 2 of the touch
 *     map subtracts the bezel viewport; baking it into stage 1 subtracts twice.
 *   - fit from INTERIOR targets only. That is the whole correction; see
 *     touch_calib_interior_x/y().
 *
 * All maths is double or integer multiply — never a host integer divide inside
 * a hot path, and never an sdiv/udiv instruction (Cortex-A8 has no hardware
 * divide; see ../../CLAUDE.md).

 * interior sample on Y, which is why the interior mask is per-axis.
 *
 * Coordinates are PANEL pixels on the reference 800x480 panel. */

/* ---- the curve that actually ships ------------------------------------- *
 * The interior fit is a straight line, and it is what gets stored: knots on the
 * line at panel dim/4 and 3*dim/4, endpoints at the line's own values for panel
 * 0 and dim-1. Those endpoints legitimately fall OUTSIDE the emittable raw range
 * — the measured-good Y fit is -279..4382 — and that is not an error to correct.
 *
 * An earlier revision clamped them into [hw_min, hw_max]. That asserts "raw
 * hw_max is emitted at panel dim-1", which is false on this hardware: measured
 * on RW09 the digitiser saturates at raw 4095 from panel ~450 of 480 and at raw 0
 * from panel ~30, so the clamp tilted the upper outer segment and the reported
 * position ran ahead of the finger by up to +19 px across the bottom quarter.
 *
 * The consequence of storing the honest line is that the saturated bands really
 * are unreachable — about 30 panel rows at each end of Y on RW09, and none worth
 * mentioning on X. That is a property of the digitiser, not of the fit, and it is
 * reported rather than papered over: touch_calib_reach() says where raw hw_min
 * and hw_max land, and touch_calib_inset_from_reach() turns that into the
 * per-side logical inset apps use to keep controls pressable. The band stays
 * fully drawable — it is good for a status bar, a score row or a background.
 *
 * The three-segment form is kept even though the shipped curve is now a straight
 * line (knots on a line ARE that line). It costs nothing, the file format is
 * unchanged — which matters, because a component that links a stale
 * touch_input.o misparses a changed line 1 silently — and it leaves room if a
 * panel ever does show real interior curvature. */

 *
 * A press against the bezel cannot answer this — it reads the same whether
 * saturation begins at the edge or 30 px inside it, and that ambiguity is what
 * kept the endpoint bug alive across three sessions.
 *
 * Edge numbering is fixed: 0 TOP, 1 BOTTOM, 2 LEFT, 3 RIGHT. TOP/BOTTOM measure
 * raw_y and run along x; LEFT/RIGHT measure raw_x and run along y. TOP and LEFT
