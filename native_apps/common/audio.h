/**
 * Audio Library for RoomWizard native games
 *
 * Hardware path:
 *   TWL4030 HiFi DAC  →  HandsfreeL/R class-D amp  →  SPKR1
 *   Kernel interface:  /dev/dsp  (ALSA OSS compatibility layer)
 *   Amp enable:        GPIO12 sysfs (active HIGH)
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   /etc/init.d/audio-enable must have run to configure the ALSA
 *   HandsfreeL/R mixer path.  This is installed automatically by
 *   build-and-deploy.sh with the 'permanent' flag.
 *   audio_init() still drives GPIO12 directly so it works even when
 *   called from a dev shell before the boot service is active.
 *
 * Typical use:
 *   Audio audio;
 *   if (audio_init(&audio) == 0) {
 *       audio_beep(&audio);          // UI click sound
 *       audio_success(&audio);       // level-up fanfare
 *       audio_close(&audio);
 *   }
 *
 * If /dev/dsp cannot be opened audio_init() returns -1 and sets
 * audio.available = false.  All playback functions are silent no-ops
 * in that state, so games work without audio hardware.

 *
 * `slot` is -1 when idle and is set by `level_defaults()`, which every entry
 * point runs — a zeroed `slot` is slot 0, i.e. somebody else's voice.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`buf` and `wav` are the mixer's `ctx`, so this struct must not be copied
 * or moved while a voice is live**: `audio_mix_add_sample()` stores the pointers.
