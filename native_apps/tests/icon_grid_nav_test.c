/* Host-side regression for icon_grid_nav() / icon_grid_nav_exit() — the
 * keyboard/pad movement shared by app_launcher and the Control Panel home.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc.  Build and run:
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/icon_grid_nav_test tests/icon_grid_nav_test.c \
 *       common/icon_grid.c common/ppm.c common/common.c common/framebuffer.c \
 *       common/touch_input.c common/hardware.c common/config.c \
 *       common/highscore.c common/keyboard.c common/audio.c common/audio_gen.c \
 *       common/audio_out.c common/audio_wav.c -lm && ./build/icon_grid_nav_test
 *
 * Group 1 pins the launcher's semantics: launcher_ref() below is the former
 * inline navigation with Left/Right made to wrap (last tile -> first, first ->
 * last), each branch otherwise guarded as it was, and the shared
 * function must agree with it for every count, cur, direction and column
 * count.  Group 2 spells the important cases out so a failure names them —
 * notably the Left/Right wrap at both ends.  Group 3 is the
 * Control Panel home's exit X.
 *
 * ⚠️ What it cannot see: the page following the selection, the ring and
 * the one-direction-per-frame pick — those are icon_grid_focus_frame()'s,
 * tested by icon_grid_focus_test.c — nor anything drawn.
