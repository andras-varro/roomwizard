/*
 * button_latch_test.c — the pause-menu-dies-after-one-use bug, on the host.
 *
 * Reported from the panel 2026-08-10: Office Runner stopped responding to the
 * hamburger menu mid-session, while the red EXIT button in the same HUD row
 * still worked.  Cause is not in either button — it is in how the caller asks.
 *
 *   button_check_press(btn, currently_pressed, now)  derives the press EDGE
 *   itself, from btn->was_pressed.  It clears that latch on exactly one kind of
 *   call: one where currently_pressed is FALSE.  A caller that only ever calls
 *   it with true therefore fires once per process and is dead thereafter.
 *
 * platformer.c and frogger.c both had:
 *     if (button_is_touched(&menu_button, ts.x, ts.y) &&
 *         button_check_press(&menu_button, true, now))        <-- short-circuit
 * so the false call never happens.  brick_breaker.c and tetris.c pass the value
 * instead, which is why their pause menus keep working — but only because their
 * players tap elsewhere constantly, which is what produces the false call.
 *
 * EXIT hid the whole thing: it only ever needs to fire once, because it ends the
 * process.  Same defect, no symptom.
 *
 * Group A is the negative control on this harness: it drives the OLD idiom and
 * asserts the reported symptom reproduces.  Without it, a green suite would not
 * distinguish "the fix works" from "the harness cannot see the bug".
 *
 * Build (host gcc, from native_apps/):
