# Measure that audio_tone_test's groups I and J can FAIL.  Copies only; the tree is
# untouched — ⚠️ never restore a sabotage with git, it would destroy whatever fix
# is still uncommitted beside it.
#
# ⚠️ Read the output, do not count it.  A stanza whose pattern has rotted prints
# "NO-OP EDIT" rather than "0 failed", and "0 failed" from a real edit is a HOLE
# in the suite, not a pass.  Case 8 is why there is a content assertion at all:
# every OTHER check in group I reads a position, and a fill that replays the
# clip's head advances every position correctly.
#
# Group I is the RAM-resident clip; group J is the device preference the unchecked
# init must resolve.  Both live here because both compile the same binary and the
# run() below is the only copy of that build line outside tests/run-all.sh.

# ── group J: the device preference the unchecked init owes ───────────────────
# 9 restores the PRE-FIX body of audio_init_unchecked() exactly — `return
# audio_open(audio);` and nothing else.  That is the shape that shipped, and it made
# both hardware speaker tests play on the panel whatever `audio_device` said.
#
# ⚠️ 10 prints "0 failed" and that is EXPECTED, which is the one place in this file
# where a zero is not a hole.  Measured 2026-09-10.  It swaps the unchecked init for
# the config-gated audio_init(), which would abolish the bypass — and group J cannot
# see it, because CONFIG_FILE_PATH is absolute and no host test can put an
# `audio_enabled=false` file at /opt/games/rw_config.conf.  With no file, audio_init()
# defaults the gate OPEN and the two paths are indistinguishable from here.  The same
# absence makes every "resolved the wrong value" variant unreachable: the stored value
# on this host is always the default.  So group J's host-reachable content is exactly
# "the preference is not inherited from process state, and it equals the stored one" —
# which is the defect that shipped, and 9 proves it can fail.  Do not delete 10; it is
# the record of what the host cannot reach, and it would start failing the day the
# config path becomes overridable.
