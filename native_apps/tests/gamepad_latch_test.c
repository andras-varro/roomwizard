/* Host-side regression for gamepad.c's held-state model: an event-driven source
 * (pad button, D-pad hat, keyboard) keeps its level in GamepadManager.held_latched[]
 * because a key-up may be many frames away, while an absolute-position source
 * (touch region, analog stick) is rebuilt every poll so it cannot latch.  Both
 * used to write the caller's InputState and only the first kind was ever cleared,
 * which left a virtual D-pad asserted for the life of the process.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc, not on the device:
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/gamepad_latch_test tests/gamepad_latch_test.c \
 *       common/gamepad.c common/input_slots.c common/input_scan.c common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c \
 *       common/config.c common/touch_input.c -lm && ./build/gamepad_latch_test
 *
 * The bug: `.held` used to be *stored* in the caller's InputState, written
 * directly by every source and cleared by none.  For the event-driven sources
 * (keys, D-pad hat) that was correct — a key-up event clears it.  For the two
 * sources that report an absolute position it was not: a touch region and the
 * analog-stick→D-pad merge both set `.held = true` and nothing ever set it
 * false, so one tap on a virtual pad ran the player left forever, and a `.pressed`
 * reader saw its first tap and then nothing (confirmed on RW09 2026-08-02 in
 * frogger: the zones stayed highlighted and the frog jumped on its own).
 *
 * The fix splits the two kinds of source: event-driven level state lives in
 * GamepadManager.held_latched[], position-reporting sources go into a per-frame
 * array, and `state->buttons[i].held` becomes a pure output = latched||derived.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS TESTABLE ON THE HOST AT ALL, given there is no /dev/uinput on the
 * device and touch cannot be synthesised there (see CLAUDE.md): gamepad_poll()
 * takes the touch coordinate as a plain argument, and the evdev sources are just
 * read(2) on an fd.  So a temp file full of struct input_event, assigned to
 * gm.gamepad_fd, drives the real poll_gamepad() — read() returns each event and
 * then 0 at EOF, exactly like a non-blocking evdev fd going quiet.  No device,
 * no kernel support, no human at the panel.  What still needs the panel is only
 * whether a *game* feels right; the state machine is covered here.
 *
 * NOT run by build-and-deploy.sh — that cross-compiles for ARM, this is host gcc.
