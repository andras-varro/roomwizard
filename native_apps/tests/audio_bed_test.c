/*
 * audio_bed_test — the SOUND SET's resolution rules, on the host
 *
 * A game's music paths used to be DERIVED in C from a stem and a
 * count each game passed to audio_bed_init(); they now live in one place, the
 * per-game set file that native_apps/sound-sets.sh generates, and the C side
 * derives nothing.  That moved four rules out of "obvious" and into "asserted":
 *
 *   A  the playlist is the file's, in the file's order, and slot 0 has no number
 *   B  "<tag>_music=" PRESENT AND EMPTY is the whole-game off switch
 *   C  "<tag>_music" ABSENT is NOT the off switch — the later tracks still play
 *   D  a gap in the numbering ends nothing; a file naming nothing is silence
 *   E  AUDIO_BED_MAX_TRACKS bounds the walk, and the overflow key is ignored
 *   F  config_load_sound_set() builds the path the generator installs to
 *
 * ⚠️ E is also what pins the key NUMBERING, and it is the only group that can.
 * Measured by sabotage: shifting the numbered key from `i + 1` to `i` leaves
 * groups A, C and D all PASSING, because their files use consecutive keys and the
 * shift merely skips a `_music1` that was never there.  Only a file that reaches
 * the cap notices.  So if E is ever weakened, the numbering loses its only test.
 *
 * ⚠️ B and C are ONE line apart in audio_bed.c and mean opposite things.  Before
 * this change both spellings reached the same `config_get(..., def)` call with a
 * derived default behind it, so "absent" could not be distinguished from "empty"
 * at all — conflating them now silences a game whose track-1 line was merely
 * deleted, and nothing on the panel says which of the two happened.  Group C is
 * the only thing in the tree that can see that.
 *
 * ⚠️ This drives audio_bed_set_playlist(), not audio_bed_init(): the latter reads
 * CONFIG_SOUND_SET_DIR, which is /opt/roomwizard/soundsets and does not exist on
 * a dev host.  The split is deliberate and audio_bed.h says so.  bed_load() below
 * reproduces exactly what audio_bed_init() does around the call, and group F
 * asserts the path half separately — so the two together cover the function.
 *
 * ⚠️ audio_bed_service() is NOT covered here.  Every one of its transitions calls
 * audio_music_*(), which needs /dev/dsp; it stays ear-only on the panel.
 *
 * Build and run (host gcc — build-and-deploy.sh does not run this):
 *
 *   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common -Itests/hostshim \
 *       -o build/audio_bed_test tests/audio_bed_test.c \
 *       common/audio_bed.c common/config.c \
 *       common/audio.c common/audio_gen.c common/audio_out.c common/audio_wav.c \
 *       -lm && ./build/audio_bed_test
