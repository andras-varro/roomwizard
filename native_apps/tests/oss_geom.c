/* oss_geom.c — Phase 0 probe for F1's continuous-stream unification.
 *
 * Answers, for BOTH client configurations, in one run on one unit:
 *   - what the OSS shim GRANTS (rate / bits / channels), read back with SOUND_PCM_READ_*
 *   - the ring geometry it hands us with NO SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT (fragsize, fragstotal)
 *
 * Why this exists. The shared device half's central arithmetic is "hold a lead of
 * AUDIO_PUMP_LEAD_PERIODS (3) whole device periods", and that constant was calibrated at
 * 44100/stereo where a period is 2048 frames (139 ms). ScummVM runs 22050 MONO, whose period
 * is unmeasured. If the shim gives mono a 4096-frame period, three of them is ~557 ms of lead
 * — a worse regression than the click the unification exists to fix. So the lead has to be a
 * per-client number derived from a measurement, not a shared constant.
 *
 * It also settles two standing questions:
 *   - the ~506 ms vs 743 ms ring contradiction (audio.c:233 and :396 reason from 506; the
 *     group-M test fixture says 32768 frames = 743 ms)
 *   - what audio.c's SNDCTL_DSP_STEREO request actually grants. That ioctl is documented in
 *     audio.c:74 as SILENTLY IGNORED on this hardware, and /proc/.../hw_params cannot answer
 *     it: the shim's plugin layer converts, so hw_params reports the stereo-only HARDWARE
 *     substream whatever the client asked for. Only SOUND_PCM_READ_CHANNELS sees the client
 *     side.
 *
 * Writes nothing to the device and does not touch GPIO12, so it makes no sound and needs no
 * listener. Standalone probe: uses no Audio struct and is deliberately NOT in
 * build-and-deploy.sh (same class as ch_test.c, oss_diag.c, oss_play.c).
 *
 * Build:
 *   arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -static -o build/oss_geom tests/oss_geom.c
