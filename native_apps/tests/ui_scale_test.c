/* Host-side regression for the design-pixel -> surface-pixel UI scale.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc.  Like bezel_scale_test.c it tests the
 * pure half of a device-only mechanism: the surface:panel ratio is only known
 * after fb_apply_viewport() has read /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display0/
 * timings, which exists on no host, so the arithmetic was split out to be
 * reachable here.  Build and run:
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/ui_scale_test tests/ui_scale_test.c \
 *       common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c common/config.c -lm \
 *       && ./build/ui_scale_test
 *
 * What can go wrong, and why each group is here.  A control that must keep its
 * PHYSICAL size is a fixed fraction of the panel, and a scaling DSS overlay draws
 * a smaller surface upscaled to fill that panel — so a constant left in surface
 * pixels grows on the panel by the upscale factor.  Measured consequences at a
 * 400x240 surface before the conversion existed: the shared 3-button game-over
 * stack (3*60 + 2*15 = 210 design px) covered 88% of the 240 rows and buried the
 * title, score and leaderboard under itself, and modal_dialog's 420 px box was
 * WIDER than the 400 px surface, putting both side borders off it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Group 1 is the NEGATIVE CONTROL and it is the group that protects the field:
 * at the shipped 800x480 geometry every conversion must be a bit-exact no-op, or
 * this is a regression on every unit in service.  ⚠️ But note what it CANNOT
 * catch, for the same reason bezel_scale_test.c's group 1 cannot: at 1:1 every
 * ratio is the identity, so no error in the ratio itself can fail group 1.  A
 * variant that scaled unconditionally — dropping the panel == surf guard, which is
 * therefore an optimisation and not a behaviour — passes group 1.  Groups 3-5 are
 * what catch an inverted or transposed ratio.
 *
 * ⚠️ Group 2 states the PORTRAIT geometry, and against the pure function it is
 * arithmetically the same identity as group 1 — panel == surf there too, so it
 * catches nothing group 1 does not.  It is kept because the numbers are the ones a
 * reader needs, and the portrait control that DOES bite lives in group 8.
 *
 * ⚠️ Group 8 drives the WRAPPERS, and it is not optional: a fixed-reference or
 * transposed wrapper is invisible to every other group, because they all hand the
 * ratio in as parameters.  Measured — SAB 3 and SAB 4 below each fail group 8 and
 * NOTHING ELSE, one assertion apiece.  Without group 8 both defects ship green.
 * The fixed-divisor class already shipped once here: fb_plane_bench derived its
 * text scale as h/120 and drew at scale 1 instead of 2, because the bezel had cut
 * the height it divided from 240 to 227.
 *
 * Group 6 is the floor: a positive design size must never round away to zero,
 * because a zero-pixel control is invisible AND untappable and the caller cannot
 * tell those apart afterwards.
 *
 * Seen failing — measured 2026-09-11 against four sabotaged variants of
 * common/framebuffer.c, each applied to a pristine copy and the source restored
 * and md5-verified afterwards:
 *   - SAB 1, "never scale" (the pre-change behaviour, return px always):
 *     13 failures, groups 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.  Groups 1, 2 and 7 pass, as they must.
 *   - SAB 2, inverted ratio (px * panel_dim / surf_dim): 14 failures, same groups.
 *   - SAB 3, wrapper against a fixed 800x480 instead of screen_true_panel_*:
 *     1 failure, group 8 ONLY — the portrait assertion.
 *   - SAB 4, wrappers transposed (fb_ui_px_x reading the height pair):
 *     1 failure, group 8 ONLY — the differing-ratio assertion.
