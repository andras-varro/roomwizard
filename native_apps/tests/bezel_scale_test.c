/* Host-side regression for the panel->surface bezel conversion.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc.  The function it tests is the pure
 * half of a device-only mechanism: fb_apply_viewport() reads the panel size from
 * /sys/devices/platform/omapdss/display0/timings, which exists on no host, so
 * the arithmetic was split out to be reachable here.  Build and run:
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/bezel_scale_test tests/bezel_scale_test.c \
 *       common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c common/config.c -lm \
 *       && ./build/bezel_scale_test
 *
 * What can go wrong, and why each group is here.  The margins name pixels the
 * plastic bezel physically covers, so they are PANEL pixels.  A scaling DSS
 * overlay draws a smaller surface upscaled to fill the panel, so subtracting a
 * panel-space margin from the surface spends it at the upscale factor: measured
 * on .188, a 400x240 surface upscaled 2x turned T=15 into 30 of the panel's 480
 * rows, and the operator saw the resulting band at top and bottom.
 *
 * ⚠️ Group 1 is the NEGATIVE CONTROL: at the shipped 800x480 geometry the
 * conversion must be a bit-exact no-op, or this is a regression on every unit in
 * the field.  ⚠️ But measured against three sabotaged variants, group 1 catches
 * LESS than it looks like it does, and the reason is worth knowing before
 * trusting it: at 1:1 every ratio is the identity, so NO error in the ratio can
 * fail group 1.  Scaling unconditionally (dropping the panel != surf guard, which
 * is therefore an optimisation and not a behaviour) passes all six groups.  An
 * inverted or axis-swapped ratio is caught by groups 2-4 and 6 instead, and the
 * axis-swapped variant does not even reach a verdict — it divides by group 5's
 * zero panel height and dies of SIGFPE, which is a detection by crash rather
 * than by assertion.  What group 1 does protect against is a version that scales
 * by anything that is not the ratio at all.
 * Group 5 is the other control: the pre-fix behaviour was "never scale", and that
 * variant passes groups 1 and 5 and fails 2-4 and 6 with 8 failures — measured,
 * so this test has been seen failing on the defect it exists for.
