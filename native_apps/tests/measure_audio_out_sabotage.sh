# Measure that audio_out_test can FAIL.  Copies only; the tree is untouched.
#
# `audio_out.c` is NEW, so "seen failing against the pre-change source" has no
# older file to compile against — this sweep is that evidence instead.  Each
# stanza breaks exactly one rule the library states in its header and reports how
# many of the suite's checks notice.  A count of 0 is a HOLE IN THE SUITE, not a
# clean bill of health: three stanzas below found one, and the checks that close
# them were added because this ran.
#
# Structure differs from measure_audio_gen_sabotage.sh in one way only: the test
# includes "../common/audio_out.h", a path relative to its own directory, which
# -I cannot override.  So the copy reproduces the two directories rather than one
# flat dir, or the suite would compile against the REAL header while linking the
# sabotaged .c — a mismatch that reads as a pass.
