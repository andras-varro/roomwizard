/*
 * audio_mix_test — the mix bus, driven by hand
 *
 * `common/audio.c` mixes every sound on one bus and delivers it through
 * `common/audio_out.c`'s never-reset continuous stream, serviced by a per-frame
 * `audio_pump()` — the library's only playback mode.  Everything about it that is
 * arithmetic is host-tested (`tests/audio_gen_test.c`, groups I/J/K).  What no host
 * can answer is whether two sounds at once are AUDIBLE as two sounds on a 20 mm
 * speaker that sums L + R, and how short a tone can be and still be heard.  Both
 * need an ear at the panel, so this is the tool for that trip.
 *
 * What each row is for:
 *
 *   controls   LIM / LVL / STOP.  STOP is `audio_interrupt()`, "silence every
 *              voice" — note it cannot un-write what is already inside the device
 *              (one lead, ~139 ms).
 *              ⚠️ **LIMIT is the second negative control, added after the first
 *              panel session.** With `clip` at 15402 the operator heard mixed
 *              sounds as *"a distorted square wave from an overdriven
 *              amplifier"* — three voices at `AUDIO_PEAK` sum to 54000 against
 *              int16's 32767.  `LIMIT: SOFT` is the fix (a knee at one voice's
 *              peak, asymptotic to `AUDIO_MIX_CEIL`); `LIMIT: HARD` restores the
 *              rejected clamp so the difference can be heard rather than argued.
 *   tones      DRONE is 3 s at 220 Hz, `440 3s` is 3 s at 440 Hz, and the other
 *              three are 200 ms at 440 / 880 / 1760 Hz.  Tap a long one, then tap
 *              the others while it runs.  The pitches are far apart on purpose:
 *              "one tone or two" must not depend on the listener keeping count.
 *              ⚠️ **The two 3 s pads exist for a TIMBRE question, which a 200 ms
 *              blip cannot answer.** Defect 3's decisive test is whether ONE voice
 *              at `AUDIO_PEAK` sounds like a clean sine — the operator compared the
 *              device against a phone signal generator and heard a square wave —
 *              and that comparison needs a tone that sustains.  `440 3s` alone is
 *              one voice through a limiter whose knee is `AUDIO_PEAK` exactly, so
 *              it is byte-identical to the unlimited path: if it still sounds
 *              square, **the limiter is exonerated** and the fault is upstream of
 *              the mix entirely.  `440 3s` + DRONE is the same question for a
 *              two-voice sum, sustained long enough to compare.
 *   canned     the four sounds every game uses, unchanged signatures.  SUCCESS
 *              and FAIL are three notes each, i.e. three voices with start
 *              offsets — if either sounds like a CHORD rather than an arpeggio,
 *              the offsets are broken.  CHORD deliberately plays three notes
 *              together, so there is something to compare to.
 *   ms row     the minimum audible tone.  Same 880 Hz tone at 5 / 10 / 20 / 40 /
 *              60 / 100 ms.  Walk up the row and note the shortest one you can
 *              hear.  Nothing clamps a tone's length; what the old floor really
 *              was is ../SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md#34-audio gotcha 6.  Each stimulus is
 *              chosen by the operator, so it is self-identifying by construction —
 *              no marker clicks needed.
 *   sample row `WAV 1` / `WAV 2` / `W STOP` / `SFX` / `INH 622` — the sample voice,
 *              **this row is the experiment it exists for.** Four causes of
 *              the two-voice harshness are refuted and the survivor is this speaker
 *              on sustained pure sine PAIRS. Every other
 *              pad here is a synthesised sine, so nothing above this row can test
 *              that. Tap `WAV 1`, let the bed settle, then tap `SFX` over it: same
 *              bus, same limiter, same delivery, different waveform. If that is
 *              clean while `440 3s` + `880` is not, the answer is "effects should be
 *              samples" and the question closes as a product decision.
 *              ⚠️ **`W STOP` is not the top row's `STOP`** — it releases only the
 *              bed, so an effect over it keeps sounding.
 *              ⚠️ **`INH 622` is here because every tone pad above is an OCTAVE of
 *              every other** (220/440/880/1760), so the tool could not make an
 *              inharmonic pair and `CHORD` was the only substitute. 622 against 440
 *              is within 0.03 % of √2 — the tritone, minimum harmonic coincidence.
 *              The two music files are hand-copied, not in the repo, so
 *              "cannot open" is a deployment fact rather than a code fault.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Two of this tool's INSTRUMENTS were lying and both are fixed (2026-08-20).
 * The first invalidated a recorded refutation, which is the expensive kind:**
 *
 *   - **`CHORD` was an arpeggio.** Three back-to-back `audio_tone()` calls are
 *     consecutive statements, so `AUDIO_TONE_CHAIN_MS`'s recency gate read them as
 *     one motif and chained each behind the last. A refutation says "HARD vs SOFT was
 *     inaudible, therefore clipping is refuted" — and that A/B was judged with this
 *     pad, which never put two voices on the bus at once. It is now three
 *     `audio_mix_add()` calls at delay 0.
 *   - **The limiter label printed the tool's own variable.** `audio_mix_init()` sets
 *     `AUDIO_MIX_HARD` and the tool's bool started false, so the pad read `LIM:
 *     SOFT` over a HARD bus, the log agreed with it, and the first tap "turned SOFT
 *     on" by setting HARD. There is no local copy any more: the pad, the log and
 *     the toggle all read `audio_mix_get_limit()`. **An A/B tool must read its own
 *     toggles back from the library.**
 *
 * ⚠️ **The five row offsets are DERIVED from `SCREEN_SAFE_HEIGHT`, not written
 * down** — `rows_layout()`, whose comment carries what a heavily-inset panel pays
 * the shortfall with and why. A fifth row is what made that necessary: the agreed
 * offsets end at 406 and at the 48/48 inset cap the safe height is 384.
 *
 * The readout shows live voices and five counters: `clip` (samples the int16
 * store could not hold — ⚠️ **must be 0 with LIMIT: SOFT**, that is the check
 * that the limiter is engaged), `lim` (samples the soft knee bent — expected to
 * be large, not a fault), `starve` (pumps that found the ring dry with audio
 * still owed — **each one is an audible gap, and it attributes crackle to PACING
 * rather than to mixing**), `lost` (frames the device refused after the voices had
 * already advanced past them) and `drop` (sounds refused by a full bus).
 *
 * ⚠️ **`clip == 0` is NOT evidence of a clean mix** — it proves int16 did not
 * overflow, and the soft limiter guarantees that by construction.  The limiter
 * waveshapes the sum instead, which IS harmonic distortion, and this tool once
 * read PASS on every counter while the operator heard every sum as "a big
 * distortion".  `lim` is the number to read
 * for that: large `lim` means the sum is being bent, whatever `clip` says.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Two of this tool's own numbers were WRONG until 2026-08-16, and both made
 * a panel session harder to trust than the code it was judging:**
 *
 *   - **`lead` was `AUDIO_PUMP_LEAD_MS`, a constant.**  The library floors the
 *     lead at whole device periods, so the panel displayed 80 ms while the pump
 *     held ~139 — and the worst-frame warning was coloured against the same wrong
 *     number.  It now reads `audio_pump_lead()`/`audio_pump_period()` and prints
 *     the arithmetic (`139 ms (3x46)`), or `lead ?` before the first pump has
 *     measured anything.  **An A/B tool must report what the library did.**
 *   - **Every tap went to `stderr` with no `fopen` anywhere**, so from the
 *     launcher tile the log went nowhere at all and the claim that taps were
 *     recorded was false.  `main()` now `freopen()`s `stderr` onto
 *     `MIX_LOG_PATH` — which captures the library's own stderr lines in the same
 *     file, in order, with no library change.
 *
 * `worst frame` restarts on a STOP tap, because a 2474 ms first frame at boot
 * contention is not a property of the mix bus and must not sit on the panel
 * looking like one — tap STOP once the panel has settled, then measure.
 *
 * CPU is the other open question (mixing on a 600 MHz core with no FPU-friendly
 * sin()).  Measure it from another shell while sound is playing:
 *   ssh root@<ip> "top -b -n 2 | grep audio_mix_test"
 *
 * Run on device (the log needs no redirect — the tool opens it itself):
 *   /opt/games/audio_mix_test /dev/fb0 /dev/input/touchscreen0
 *   ssh root@<ip> cat /tmp/mix.log
 *
 * Build (from native_apps/).  ⚠️ `common/audio_out.c` is not optional: `audio.h`
 * includes `audio_out.h` and every `Audio` embeds an `AudioOut`, so the link fails
 * without it — which is the right failure.  `build-and-deploy.sh` gets it from
 * `$COMMON_OBJ`; this line is for building the tool by hand, with that script's
 * soft-float compiler and ALSA flags.

 * The agreed target — rows at 72/136/200/274/348 with heights 54/54/64/64/58 and
 * gaps of 10 — ends at 406 and needs a safe height of ~410. `.188` has it

/* ── the redraw A/B ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A crack is heard on every press at 5-8 voices while clip=0 starve=0, and a
 * trace of the mix found no sample discontinuity on a press.  What a press DOES
 * change is the loop: it forces draw_screen() + fb_swap() — a full clear, every
 * label and a whole-surface copy into the mapped framebuffer — in the same
 * iteration as the audio_pump() that starts the new voice.
 *
 * `DRAW PAD` removes exactly that and nothing else.  A press, and the voice
 * start it causes, repaint ONLY the pressed pad (inverted for REDRAW_LIT_MS, then
 * normal), copied into the front buffer as one small rectangle by
 * present_rect() — no clear, no fb_swap().  Everything audio-side is untouched:
 * the same pump call in the same place, the same sleep decision.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The readout must not smuggle the full redraw back in.**  The READOUT_MS
 * timer used to call draw_screen() + fb_swap() in BOTH modes whenever the voice
 * count moved — so every voice start still produced a full redraw within 250 ms
 * in DRAW PAD, and an A/B that heard the crack "in both modes" never tested a
 * loop without full redraws.  In DRAW PAD the timer now repaints only the
 * readout band (title, two counter lines, the `last` line, the voice meter —
 * present_readout()) by the same present_rect() path.  DRAW FULL is unchanged:
 * a full redraw on the press AND on the count change.  In DRAW PAD the only full
 * redraws left are the first frame and a tap on the DRAW pad itself, so its own
 * label is always the truth.  Every tap logs `redraw=full|pad`, and the timer
 * logs how many of each kind happened and how long the worst took (the `mix: t=`
 * line) — a crack that coincides with `full_draws` not moving is not this. */
