/* Host-side regression for the touch calibration fit and the curve it produces.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc, not on the device — it is pure
 * arithmetic with no hardware in the loop, which is exactly why it is worth
 * having: a wrong fit is invisible until someone is mis-tapping by 30 px on a
 * wall-mounted screen, and it took a day of on-device measurement to unpick
 * last time.
 *
 * Inputs are the 11 per-target medians recorded in the repo's reference
 * capture, ../../touch_raw-2026-07-31-rw09.tsv.  Build and run:
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/touch_calib_test tests/touch_calib_test.c \
 *       common/touch_calib.c common/touch_input.c common/framebuffer.c \
 *       common/hardware.c common/config.c -lm && ./build/touch_calib_test
 *
 * Exit 0 = the fit still reproduces the reference measurement AND the curve
 * derived from it still reports the measured digitiser reach.  That second half
 * is the point, and it is the assertion that changed: an earlier revision
 * asserted the curve reaches panel 0 and 479 on Y, which it only did because
 * touch_calib_curve_from_fit() clamped the endpoints into 0..4095 to force it.
 * The clamp was the bug.  Measured with touch_raw on 2026-08-01, the digitiser
 * saturates at raw 4095 from panel ~450 and at raw 0 from panel ~30, so the
 * honest curve reaches 28..449 and the bands outside that are unreachable.  They
 * remain fully drawable — see SCREEN_SAFE_* vs SCREEN_VISIBLE_* in framebuffer.h.
 *
 * NOT part of build-and-deploy.sh: that script cross-compiles for ARM and this
 * is a host binary.  Run it by hand after touching common/touch_calib.c,
 * touch_fit_axis_range() or touch_map_axis_panel().
