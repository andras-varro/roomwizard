# Measure that launcher_args_test can FAIL, one targeted defect per group.
#
# There is no pre-fix source for a new test, so "seen passing" is not evidence
# it can fail.  Each case below copies native_apps/app_launcher/app_launcher.c
# to a scratch tree, breaks parse_args() in the copy in exactly one way, shadows
# the real file with -I over the copy, rebuilds the test and reports whether the
# group that defect targets went red.
#
# Case 0 is the control on the harness itself: the same rig with an untouched
# copy must be GREEN.  Without it a rig that failed to shadow, or failed to
# compile, would report every group "caught" or every group "not caught" for a
# reason that has nothing to do with the assertions.
#
# Group F can only fail by CRASHING — its assertion is that parse_args(NULL)
# does not dereference — so the verdict reads the exit status as well as the
# FAIL lines, and stdbuf line-buffers the run because a crash otherwise takes
# libc's buffered output with it and a caught sabotage reads as an undetected
# one.
#
# Restores are file copies from a pristine scratch copy.  git is never invoked:
# a checkout here would destroy whatever uncommitted work is being measured.
# Nothing is written inside the repo.
set -u

# Both files travel together, so the test is beside this script wherever the
# pair lives.  Resolved before the cd, because the cd is what makes -I. mean
# native_apps.
