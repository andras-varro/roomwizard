/* Host-side regression for app_launcher's `args=` manifest field.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc, not on the device.  parse_args() is
 * pure logic — two libc string calls over a caller's `const char *`, no globals,
 * no fd, no exit() — so nothing about it needs a panel, a /dev/fb0 or a manifest
 * on disk.  What it DOES need is to be reachable: it is `static` inside a
 * main()-bearing translation unit, so this test `#include`s app_launcher.c
 * itself and the build line neutralises its entry point with
 * -Dmain=app_launcher_main_unused, then `#undef main` takes the name back for
 * the test's own.  That redirect is a test-only flag and changes no shipped
 * byte — the alternative, copying the eight lines in here, would test the copy
 * and stay green forever after the shipped function changed underneath it.  The
 * price of the include is the link line below: the whole launcher TU is
 * compiled, so every object app_launcher normally links has to be present even
 * though only parse_args() is ever called.
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I. -Itests/hostshim -Dmain=app_launcher_main_unused \
 *       -o build/launcher_args_test tests/launcher_args_test.c \
 *       common/framebuffer.c common/touch_input.c common/hardware.c common/common.c \
 *       common/highscore.c common/keyboard.c common/audio.c common/audio_gen.c \
 *       common/audio_out.c common/audio_wav.c common/config.c common/gamepad.c \
 *       common/ppm.c common/logger.c -lm && ./build/launcher_args_test
 *
 * What it asserts, and why: the four `args=` spellings app_launcher.c's own
 * manifest-format comment documents (fb,touch / fb / touch / none) each reach
 * the ArgMode the launcher then turns into the child's argv, and — the half
 * that is easy to "fix" — the matching is SUBSTRING, via strstr(), not
 * tokenised on commas.  So `offbeat` selects ARG_FB and `untouched` selects
 * ARG_TOUCH, while `framebuffer` selects neither because it holds no `fb`
 * bigram at all; a rewrite to token matching keeps group A green and breaks
 * group B alone, which is the only reason group B exists.  `none` is the one
 * spelling compared whole-string, so it loses to a substring the moment
 * anything sits beside it (`none,fb` is ARG_FB).  The unmatched fallback is
 * ARG_FB_TOUCH, which is also what a correct `fb,touch` returns — so a
 * misspelled manifest is indistinguishable from the default, deliberately, and
 * group D pins that.  Case sensitivity (group E) and a NULL argument (group F,
 * safe: the `!s` test short-circuits ahead of every dereference) are pinned as
 * the code actually behaves rather than as one might wish.  Every expectation
 * that reads like a bug carries a comment saying why it is that value; they are
 * pinned quirks, not defects to tidy.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every expected value below is a LITERAL, never the ArgMode enumerator it
 * describes.  Measured: written as `ARG_FB` the whole file passes with the enum
 * swapped to ARG_FB = 2 / ARG_TOUCH = 1, because subject and test move together
 * and parse_args() composes those values with `|=` — a defect the launcher's
 * argv would carry straight to the child.  Group A pins the four numbers
 * themselves for the same reason.
 *
 * NOT part of build-and-deploy.sh: that script cross-compiles for ARM and this
 * is a host binary.  Negative control: tests/measure_launcher_args_sabotage.sh,
 * one targeted defect per group, every one seen turning that group red.
