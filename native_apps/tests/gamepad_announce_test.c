/* Host-side regression for the device-announcement volume in gamepad.c.
 *
 * gamepad_rescan() closes every device and re-opens it, on a 5 s timer in all
 * nine apps.  scan_devices() prints "found gamepad ..." inside an `fd < 0`
 * branch that the close it was just handed always makes true, so an unchanged
 * pad is re-announced on every tick — measured on .188 as 1720 identical lines
 * in one session, in the log that a no-microphone audio verification has to
 * read.  What must be true instead: announce a CHANGE, keep the first
 * announcement, and say so once when a device goes away.
 *
 * WARNING: this test needs a real evdev node, because the defect lives in the
 * open/classify path and a regular file cannot classify as a gamepad — the
 * EVIOCGBIT ioctls fail on one.  It therefore synthesises a pad through
 * /dev/uinput, which on this dev host is root-only.  Without it the test
 * SKIPS and says so; it does not pass quietly, because a pass here would mean
 * the announcement behaviour was never measured at all.  To actually reach it,
 * run THIS test as root rather than the whole gate:
 *
 *   wsl.exe -u root -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard/native_apps && \
 *       gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/gamepad_announce_test tests/gamepad_announce_test.c \
 *       common/gamepad.c common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c \
 *       common/config.c common/touch_input.c -lm && ./build/gamepad_announce_test"
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-08: the whole gate under `wsl.exe -u root` does NOT reach
 * phase 2 on this host.  Phase 1's commission_prep_test.sh exits 2 as root, and
 * phase 2 returns without a word while any harness error stands; phase 3 then
 * fails too, because git refuses a repo it sees as dubiously owned.  Both are
 * artefacts of the shell, not of the repo.
 *
 * Build (this line is the CTEST_ROWS row in tests/run-all.sh):
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/gamepad_announce_test tests/gamepad_announce_test.c \
 *       common/gamepad.c common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c \
 *       common/config.c common/touch_input.c -lm
 *
 * Measured against the pre-fix source, three runs, identical each time:
 * 4 passed, 2 failed.  The two that failed are the defect and its missing other
 * half.  The four that already passed are not evidence of anything on their
 * own, and two of them are deliberately controls against OVER-suppression:
 * "a still-absent pad is not reported again" is vacuous pre-fix (nothing was
 * ever reported), and "a returning pad is announced again" passes pre-fix for
 * the wrong reason (pre-fix announces unconditionally).  They earn their keep
 * only after the fix, where a slot that is never cleared would break the second
 * and a slot cleared too eagerly would break the first.
