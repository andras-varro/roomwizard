/* Host-side regression for the framebuffer's bits-per-pixel dispatch.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc, not on the device.  The drawing
 * primitives only touch fb->back_buffer / width / height / bytes_per_pixel /
 * double_buffering, so a synthetic Framebuffer over a malloc'd buffer exercises
 * the real code with no /dev/fb0 in the loop — the pattern gradient_test.c
 * established, and the only way to see this bug at all: it is a heap overflow,
 * so on the device it corrupts whatever malloc handed out next rather than
 * drawing anything visibly wrong.
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/framebuffer_bpp_test tests/framebuffer_bpp_test.c \
 *       common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c common/config.c \
 *       common/touch_input.c -lm && ./build/framebuffer_bpp_test
 *
 * What it asserts, and why (IMPROVEMENT_PLAN B1/B24): the back buffer is sized
 * width * height * bytes_per_pixel, but every primitive used to write a
 * uint32_t unconditionally.  At 16bpp — which is what ScummVM and vnc_client
 * set, and what a game launched over SSH after one of them INHERITS, because no
 * game asserted the bpp (B24) — that addresses twice the allocation.  Observed
 * on RW09 2026-08-02: a stale vnc_client left /dev/fb0 at 16bpp and
 * brick_breaker came up at "800x455 ... 16 bpp", running the full 2x overflow.
 *
 * The mechanism, so the assertions read as deliberate: a guard region is placed
 * immediately after the logical back buffer and filled with a sentinel.  Every
 * primitive is then driven over the whole surface INCLUDING its last pixel.  A
 * uint32_t write at the last 16bpp pixel index lands one whole buffer past the
 * end, so the guard catches it.  The pixel-value checks are the other half: a
 * primitive could stay in bounds and still write 32bpp words into a 16bpp
 * surface, which reads back as garbage colour.
 *
 * NOT part of build-and-deploy.sh: that script cross-compiles for ARM and this
 * is a host binary.  Run it by hand after touching a drawing primitive.
