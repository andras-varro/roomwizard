/* Host-side regression for the raw -> panel -> logical touch map.
 *
 * Runs on the DEV MACHINE with native gcc, not on the device.  touch_map_raw()
 * is a pass-through to scale_coordinates(), which is pure arithmetic over the
 * fields of one TouchInput — no fd, no ioctl, no framebuffer — so a struct
 * filled in by hand drives the production path exactly as touch_poll() does.
 * That is the whole reason this is worth having on the host: the symptom of a
 * wrong map is a cursor that runs ahead of the finger on a wall-mounted panel,
 * and touch cannot be scripted on the device at all (no /dev/uinput — see
 * ../CLAUDE.md), so every question that does NOT need a finger has to be asked
 * here or it is not asked.  touch_init() is deliberately never called: it
 * open()s the device, and the touch_set_* helpers printf and mutate the
 * framebuffer globals.  Nothing in this file needs either.
 *
 *   cd native_apps && gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common \
 *       -o build/touch_map_test tests/touch_map_test.c common/touch_input.c \
 *       common/framebuffer.c common/hardware.c common/config.c -lm \
 *       && ./build/touch_map_test
 *
 * What it asserts, and why.  Nine groups, each pinning one thing the two stages
 * are supposed to do.  A and B are the arithmetic itself: the uncalibrated
 * sentinel range (knots 0,0) must behave as one straight line onto panel
 * 0..dim-1, and a real three-segment curve must put its two stored knots on
 * panel dim/4 and 3*dim/4 exactly — those fractions are implicit in the file
 * format, so a shifted knot silently reinterprets every calibration on every
 * unit.  C is the raw clamp, and it is asserted on an OVERSIZED logical screen
 * on purpose: at 800x480 the final logical clamp produces the same number, so a
 * removed raw clamp is invisible, whereas with screen 1000x600 the unclamped
 * value (818 on X, 504 on Y) is in range and shows.  The low side of that clamp
 * has no such witness — below the low endpoint the segment is negative whatever
 * you do, so the non-negativity there belongs to the final clamp and not to the
 * raw one, and this file cannot separate them.  D is the invariant an app
 * actually depends on: no output is ever negative or >= the logical dimension,
 * swept over a grid of raw values far outside 0..4095 in six geometries, plus
 * per-axis monotonicity so a sign slip cannot hide inside the bounds.  E is the
 * SIDE EFFECT, which is the surprising part of this function: a raw span of
 * <= 0 does not merely map badly, it REWRITES the struct it was handed to
 * 0..4095 with the knots zeroed, so the assertions are on the struct afterwards
 * as well as on the value, one axis at a time so a mutation cannot leak across.
 * E also pins the two things that are NOT degenerate: a span of 1, and a valid
 * span, which must come back untouched.  F is the portrait rotation, where the
 * logical X comes from raw Y inverted and the logical Y from raw X — the axis
 * swap is what a fresh reading of this code always gets backwards.  G is stage
 * 2 alone (the bezel viewport origin, subtracted, never added).  H pins that
 * the clamp reads screen_width/screen_height rather than the panel 800x480,
 * which is what a component running a smaller surface depends on.  I is the
 * defensive fallback: a knot set that is not strictly increasing must map
 * coarsely-but-linearly rather than folding the axis back on itself.
 *
 * Expected values were derived by hand from the model in touch_input.h and
 * cross-checked against an independent integer model, not read off a run of the
 * code under test.
 *
 * NOT part of build-and-deploy.sh: that script cross-compiles for ARM and this
 * is a host binary.  Run it by hand after touching scale_coordinates(),
 * touch_map_axis_panel(), axis_dims() or the calibration file format.
