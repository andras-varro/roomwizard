/*
 * audio_out_test.c — the one output stream, on the host, with no fd in it.
 *
 * `common/audio_out.c` is the device half of the audio library: it opens the
 * device once, reads the GRANT back, prefills silence, and then never resets and
 * never reconfigures until shutdown.  That is the click's fix — the click is a
 * stream transition, and every canned sound used to be a full stop and start.
 * This drives all of it through the injectable `AudioOutDev` vtable, so the whole
 * file is reachable on the host and no test here opens anything.
 *
 * GROUP A IS THE NEGATIVE CONTROL and it drives the OLD idiom, transcribed from
 * the shipped file (`audio.c` as of 2026-08-18, 710 lines):
 *
 *   A1  a ring reset before EVERY sound.  `audio_flush()` (audio.c:206-215) fired
 *       it and re-ran `configure_dsp()`, and `play_sequence()` (:679) called it
 *       before each canned sound — so a game with N sounds performs N stream
 *       transitions, which is what the operator hears as "every time there is a
 *       sound, there is a click".
 *   A2  the ~60 ms floor.  ⚠️ **MODELLED, not measured here**: the fake device
 *       swallows a start-up run of frames after each transition, which is the
 *       mechanism `audio.c:196-199` attributes the rule to.  A 30 ms tone through
 *       the old idiom is therefore inaudible and the same tone through the stream
 *       is not.  The frame count is a stand-in for ~50 ms of DAC pipeline start-up;
 *       nothing in the tree ever clamped 60 ms, it is prose only.
 *
 * Group B is the GRANT: every byte count in the library derives from what the
 * device granted, never from what was asked for, and a 0-channel grant is refused
 * rather than turned into a 0-byte write.  Group C is the lead, in whole device
 * periods.  Group D is the serviced mode, including the two counters that mean
 * one thing each.  Group E is the single fill callback and the loud refusal that
 * keeps two writers impossible.  Group F is the attenuation, swept over every
 * int16 at shift 0 and shift 1 — `-1 >> 1 == -1` is why it is a shift and not a
 * gain multiply, and it is what keeps ScummVM bit-identical to what was verified
 * on the panel.  Group G is the synchronous mode the two Settings tabs need,
 * which have no render loop at all.  Group H is the bounded drain.  Group I is
 * the published service ceiling, which is derived from REAL audio rather than the
 * nominal lead.  Group J is one stream per process.  Group K is which device.
 * Group L is what a failed write MEANS: the ALSA backend's error classification,
 * the device-lost flag an unplug sets, and the OSS-node → ALSA-PCM mapping — all
 * pure or vtable-driven, so a host with no libasound reaches every branch.
 * Group M is the gate in front of the replug probe: when a stream on the panel
 * speaker looks for a USB card that has come back.  Group N is the choice list a
 * settings page offers: which entries exist with the hardware that is attached,
 * what a saved choice SHOWS as, and the order a press cycles them in.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This file is NEW, so "seen failing against the pre-change source" cannot
 * mean compiling it against an older `audio_out.c` — there is none.**  The
 * equivalent evidence is `measure_audio_out_sabotage.sh`, which breaks one stated
 * rule at a time in a COPY and counts what notices.  Measured 2026-08-18:
 *
 *     sabotage                                      failed  caught by
 *      1  prefill dropped, the stream starts empty     5     A3b D6 D7 D8 D14
 *      2  scratch not zeroed before the fill           1     D4b
 *      3  service fills the free space, not the lead   8     D1 D5 D6 D7 D8 D11 …
 *      4  lead from the ms constant, not the period    8     C2 C3 C4 C5 D5 D11 …
 *      5  channels from the request, not the grant     8     B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 …
 *                                                            then SIGFPE
 *      6  attenuation as a divide, not a shift         1     F2
 *      7  mode 2 not refused against a callback        1     E4
 *      8  drain waits for zero, not the slack          1     H4
 *      9  serviced policy given a non-zero wait        1     D13c
 *     10  CONTROL: audio_out_starved() returns 0       1     D10
 *
 * ⚠️ **Case 10 is the control and its count is the one to read first**: a single
 * lying accessor must fail exactly ONE check in ONE group.  A cascade there would
 * mean the suite is coupled and every other count above is inflated.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Three stanzas read 0 on the first run and only one of the three was telling
 * the truth, so reading the sweep is part of running it:**
 *
 *   - **case 5 was a LOST BUFFER, not a pass.**  `out=$(…)` makes the child's
 *     stdout a pipe, libc switches to full buffering, and the SIGFPE discarded
 *     eight `FAIL:` lines it had already printed.  The sweep now line-buffers the
 *     child and reports the signal — without both, a sabotage that CRASHES this
 *     suite is indistinguishable from one the suite cannot see.
 *   - **case 2 was a hole in this file.**  `D4` ran after three SILENT services,
 *     so the scratch was already zero and it passed with the `memset` deleted.
 *     Split into `D4a` (dirty the scratch first) and `D4b` (the real check).
 *   - **case 9 was a hole in this file.**  Nothing separated a wait from a SLEEP,
 *     so the load-bearing `wait_us == 0` was untested.  The fake now counts
 *     `waits_slept` only at `usec > 0`, and `D13b`/`D13c` drive the one path that
 *     can break it: a permanent mid-frame stall, where the policy's stop condition
 *     deliberately does not apply.
 *
 * Case 1 still fails four pacing checks in group D, but only as a side-effect of
 * the queue being empty; `A3b` is the check that states the property itself.
 *
 * What HAS been seen failing, on 2026-08-18, is three real defects — two in the
 * suite and one in the library, all found by running it:
 *
 *   - ⚠️ **the prefill policy was UNBOUNDED and hung `audio_out_open()` forever**
 *     against a device that would not take the prefill (`max_waits = 0` means
 *     unlimited, and `stop_on_again` is false because a prefill is worth waiting
 *     for).  The suite did not report it — it hung, which is a test result.  The
 *     fix derives the bound from the buffer's own length; `D12b` is the case.
 *   - the one-stream-per-process guard turned every later group's open into a
 *     refusal, because group D re-opened six times without closing.  A cascade of
 *     28 failures from one leak.
 *   - two expectations were wrong rather than the code: a transition count that
 *     included an open that never happened, and a drain asserted to reach zero
 *     when it deliberately stops at the over-report slack.
 *
 * Needs no sudo, no device and no network.
 *
 * Build (host gcc, from native_apps/):
 *   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -I common -o build/audio_out_test \
 *       tests/audio_out_test.c common/audio_out.c common/audio_gen.c -lm && \
 *   ./build/audio_out_test
 *
 * The zero that must stay zero is checked by grep rather than by a case here,
 * because it is an absence: the steady-state path performs no ring reset at all.
 *   grep -c 'SNDCTL_DSP_RE[S]ET' native_apps/common/audio_out.c   -> 0
 * The bracket is deliberate — an unbracketed pattern would match this line and
 * the gate would count its own documentation.
