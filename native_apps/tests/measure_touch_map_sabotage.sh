# Measure that every group of touch_map_test can FAIL.
#
# touch_map_test.c is a NEW test, so there is no pre-fix revision of
# common/touch_input.c to compile it against — the only way to show it can go
# red is to break the subject on purpose.  Each case copies touch_input.c and
# touch_input.h to a scratch tree, applies ONE targeted defect to the COPY,
# rebuilds the test against that copy, and reports which assertion groups turned
# red.  The repo is never written to and git is never used: the pristine source
# is restored by file copy, because a measurement loop that restores with git
# destroys the uncommitted fix it is measuring.
#
# A sabotage that no longer matches its line prints DID-NOT-APPLY or NO-OP
# rather than "0 red", which is the difference between a suite with a hole and a
# harness with a rotted pattern.  Every case also declares the group it is aimed
# at, so a case that goes red somewhere else — a rotted replacement hitting a
# different segment — shows up as MISMATCH instead of passing for the wrong
# reason.  Read the output; do not just count it.
