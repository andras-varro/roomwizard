# Gate: the sound sets, the games and the committed beds all agree.
#
# Run from build-and-deploy.sh, beside check-arm-safe.sh, check-audio-pacing.sh
# and check-sound-assets.sh.  Standalone:
#     ./check-bed-files.sh
#
# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A missing bed is refused in SILENCE.  audio_bed_service() marks the track
# failed, prints one line into a log nobody reads at play time, and the game
# plays its effects with no music: exactly what a game with no bed at all sounds
# like.  Nothing else in the tree can see the difference.
#
# The paths live in ONE home — sound-sets.sh's RW_SOUND_SETS —
# and the C side derives nothing, so this gate no longer reads a convention out
# of a call site.  It reads the table, and checks FIVE things:
#
#   1. every path the table names exists in music/            FAIL
#   2. every audio_bed_init() tag has a table row             FAIL  (silent no-music)
#   3. a row's track count fits AUDIO_BED_MAX_TRACKS          FAIL  (silently ignored)
#   4. CONFIG_SOUND_SET_DIR/_EXT agree with RW_SOUND_SET_DIR/_EXT   FAIL
#   5. every committed bed reaches some row                   WARN
#      every table row reaches some game                      WARN
#
# ⚠️ (4) is the one with no other symptom: a mismatch installs seven set files
# that nothing ever opens, and all seven games simply have no music.  Both sides
# are READ here rather than restated, so this check cannot itself drift.
#
# ⚠️ (2) FAILS where the old gate WARNED-AND-EXITED-0.  Measured 2026-08-24: the
# 5-argument→1-argument signature change made the old regex match nothing, and it
# printed `games=0 want=0 missing=0 orphan=0` and exited 0 — it went blind and
# reported that as success, with 24 beds that should all have read as orphans.  A
# gate that finds no callers at all has lost its subject and must say so.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE: whether the DEVICE has the files.  It reads the repo's
# music/ directory and the generator's table, which is what build-and-deploy.sh
# uploads; a device whose /opt/sound or /opt/roomwizard/soundsets was hand-managed
# can still be missing one.  It also cannot see whether a bed SOUNDS right, and it
# is a TEXT match, so a commented-out audio_bed_init() counts as a game — which is
# how its own negative control is built (a throwaway .c under the tree naming a tag
# with no table row makes it exit 1, no shipped file touched).
