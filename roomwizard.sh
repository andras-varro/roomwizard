# roomwizard.sh — the front door: one menu over the bring-up paths
#
# This script implements NOTHING of its own. Every item shells out to the
# existing script with arguments, so anything that works today keeps working
# exactly as it did, and those scripts stay non-interactive when called directly:
#
#   commissioning/provision.sh           update a running unit, over SSH, ends in a reboot
#   deploy-all.sh                        over SSH, per-component
#   rootfs/make-card-image.sh            a whole card image, offline (runs commission-offline.sh)
#
# Why a composition layer and not one merged script: the three phases have
# genuinely different connection models, and the cleanup in Phase 2 touches paths
# spread across FOUR partitions that only a booted kernel assembles into one tree,
# while rootfs/make-card-image.sh mounts all four partitions of an image itself
# (commission-offline.sh maps every absolute path onto them); the
# SSH phases stay as the verified development loop. There are three further
# reasons in COMMISSIONING.md ("why these are separate").
#
# What this script does add is the two things missing between the phases: a
# wait_for_ssh so the operator is not guessing when a rebooted device is back,
# and a single place that knows the phases run in order.
#
# Every child is invoked as `bash <script>`, not `./<script>`. A clone can land
# without the executable bit — the mode lives in the git index, so one bad commit
# breaks every fresh clone — and `./` then fails at the point of use with
# "Permission denied". Nothing is in doubt about which interpreter to use; all
# three are #!/bin/bash. deploy-all.sh already does the same for the
# per-component scripts it discovers.
#
# Usage:
#   ./roomwizard.sh          # interactive menu

Interactive front door for RoomWizard bring-up. Menu-driven; it takes no
arguments of its own beyond --help, and reimplements none of the flags of the
scripts it calls. To script a step, call that script directly:

  ./commissioning/provision.sh <target> [flags]         update a unit (ssh, reboots)
  ./commissioning/provision.sh <target> --hostname NAME name only, no reboot
  ./deploy-all.sh <target> [component]                  deploy (ssh)
  ./rootfs/make-card-image.sh --bundle <b> <parts> <rootfs.tar> <out.img>   card image
  ./setup-build-env.sh [--install-deps] [--scummvm]     host build prerequisites

# ── the one piece of real logic: waiting for a device ────────────────────────
# Lives here rather than in the three scripts because it is only needed BETWEEN
# phases — a device that has just been powered on, or has just been rebooted by
# commissioning/provision.sh. Polling SSH itself (not ping) is deliberate: ping answers
# while sshd is still starting, which is exactly the window that produces a
# confusing "Cannot reach <ip>" from the next phase.
#
# ⚠️ It polls on `down` and STOPS on `auth`. A unit that answers and refuses our key
# is up: waiting the rest of the timeout cannot change the answer, and the old
# version spent the full 180 s doing exactly that before reporting "did not answer
# SSH" about a device that had answered every time. On that
# state it hands over to the gate, which offers to install a key.

# ── Image a card ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Builds an image file of the whole card: our Buildroot root on p6, empty p2/p3/p5,
  the release bundle installed and verified. You write the file to a card yourself
  and the unit boots working. Updating a unit that is already running is item 2.

  Before continuing:

    - this must run as root on the native WSL filesystem (not /mnt/c)
    - the parts directory is what rootfs/fetch-card-parts.sh filled
    - the root filesystem tar is what rootfs/build-rootfs.sh left in ~/br-rw-out
    - you have a bundle: ./release.sh --stage-only leaves one in build/release
    - the kernel modules are in ~/rw-kmods (cy8ctmg120_ts.ko is required)

  It never touches a block device or p1's boot files.

  Where should the binaries come from?

    s) build them from source   needs the cross-compiler and WSL; ScummVM is
                                a ~2 min link          (default — press Enter)
    b) a local bundle           build/release, from ./release.sh --stage-only.
                                Seconds instead of a rebuild, and it puts the
                                bytes you already TESTED on the device.
    r) a published release      downloaded from GitHub, sha256-checked against
                                the digest it publishes, and cached — so the
                                second unit costs no second download.

  b and r install binaries and NOTHING ELSE: a bundle carries no config, by
  construction. Touch calibration, the host name and the VNC password come from
  item 2, exactly as they do after a from-source deploy.
