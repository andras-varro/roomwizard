# lib/rw-release.sh — fetch a published release bundle from GitHub.
#
# SOURCED, not executed:   . "$REPO_ROOT/lib/rw-release.sh"
#
# ── Why this is a separate file from rw-bundle.sh ────────────────────────────
#
# rw-bundle.sh is the bundle LAYOUT, and it is deliberately network-free: it is
# sourced by four component build scripts on the write side and by the offline
# commissioner on the read side, and neither has any business opening a socket.
# This file is the one library in lib/ that does, so "does this code touch the
# network" is answerable by looking at the source list.
#
# It is also THIN on purpose.  deploy-all.sh --from-bundle and
# commissioning/commission-offline.sh --bundle both already accept either a
# tarball or an unpacked directory, install from the manifest and verify md5.  So
# a fetch is: resolve, download, verify, hand over the path.  Nothing here
# installs anything, and nothing here touches a device.
#
# ── ⚠️ Every gh call passes --repo, and it is NOT optional ───────────────────
#
# gh cannot resolve this repository from its own remote.  `origin` is an SSH host
# ALIAS (git@github.com-personal:owner/repo.git), and gh does not merely fail to
# guess the owner from it — it refuses the repository outright with "none of the
# git remotes configured for this repository point to a known GitHub host".
# Measured, not anticipated.  rw_release_repo below is the one derivation; it is
# what release.sh publishes through, so a fork fetches from the fork.
#
# ⚠️ It reads the remote URL and NOTHING ELSE from git.  `git ls-remote` and every
# other network git operation dies here with "Could not resolve hostname
# github.com-personal": the alias lives in the WINDOWS ssh config and these
# scripts run under WSL.  `remote get-url` is local, so it works.  Do not add a
# network git call to this file.
#
# ── ⚠️ sha256, never md5 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The bundle's own manifest.d/*.md5 proves the bundle is internally consistent
# once it is unpacked — it says nothing about whether the bytes that arrived are
# the bytes GitHub served, and nothing is signed.  The one authenticity check
# available is the published asset digest, and GitHub reports that as
# `sha256:…` — on `gh release view --json assets` AND on the unauthenticated REST
# API (measured 2026-09-01, both).  So a fetched asset is verified with
# sha256sum.  Comparing the manifest's md5 against that digest compares two
# different algorithms and can never agree.
#
# ── ⚠️ gh prints NO progress, so this file does ──────────────────────────────
#
# Measured 2026-09-01: `gh release download` moved all 131,434,339 bytes of
# v1.0.0 with ZERO bytes on stdout and zero on stderr.  The bundle is ~126 MB,
# most of it uncompressed mono music beds, so on any ordinary link a silent
# download is minutes of a dead terminal — which reads as a hang, and gets
# Ctrl-C'd.  _rw_release_progress polls the partial file against the size the
# resolve step already knows and prints one updating line.  It wraps curl too,
# rather than relying on curl's own bar, so both transports look the same.
#
# ── ⚠️ No jq ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# jq is NOT installed in this WSL (measured 2026-09-01) and cannot be assumed on
# a commissioning host either.  gh has its own --jq built in, which is why the gh
# path can ask for exactly the five fields it wants; the curl fallback parses with
# grep and sed, and refuses rather than guessing when a release carries more than
# one tarball (see rw_release_resolve).
#
# ── ⚠️ stdout carries the ANSWER and nothing else ────────────────────────────
#
# Callers do `path="$(rw_release_fetch …)"`, which runs this in a subshell — so
# every diagnostic, every progress line and every warning goes to stderr, and any
# global set in here is discarded.  Same trap as rw_ssh_probe (lib/CLAUDE.md);
# here it is avoided by having no globals to lose.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# rw_release_repo [REPO_DIR]
#
# Print "owner/repo" derived from REPO_DIR's origin remote.  Derived rather than
# hardcoded, so a fork fetches from and publishes to the fork.
#
# Strips any scheme, any user@host prefix, and the trailing .git — which handles
# all three forms this repo has been cloned as: the SSH host alias
# git@github.com-personal:owner/repo.git, plain git@github.com:owner/repo.git,
# and https://github.com/owner/repo.

#
# gh first, because it is the only path that works for a private repo; the
# unauthenticated REST API second, which is enough for this repo because it is
# public.  gh is skipped rather than trusted when it is present but not logged
# in — an unauthenticated gh fails on a public repo where plain curl succeeds.
#
# ⚠️ Refuses a release with no digest, and refuses one carrying more than one
# tarball.  An asset that cannot be verified is not a safer install than no
# install, and picking one of several tarballs silently would put a different set
# of components on the device than the operator asked for.  GitHub's auto-made
# "Source code (tar.gz)" is not an asset, so it does not trip the second rule.
