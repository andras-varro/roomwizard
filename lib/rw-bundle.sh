#
# ── ⚠️ A bundle carries BUILT ARTIFACTS ONLY, and that is a decision ──────────
#
# Deliberate, decided 2026-09-01: no device scripts go in.  A holder of nothing but
# the tarball therefore gets xpad.ko/joydev.ko/ff-memless.ko/devmem_write and nothing
# that loads them at boot, and gets no roomwizard-app or disable-steelcase.sh either.
# That is not a gap to fix.  commissioning/commission-offline.sh is the only consumer
# that installs those, it runs from a clone, so it has device-files/ beside it either
# way — a self-sufficient tarball would buy a second copy of them and a second path
# for an exec= to drift along.
#
# ⚠️ release.sh's refusal to publish CONFIG and VENDOR FIRMWARE is a different rule
# and stays whatever happens here: those keep a plaintext password and 5 MB of
# Steelcase kernel out of a public release.  A device script is neither.
# ── ⚠️ Modes are DECLARED, never read off disk ───────────────────────────────
#
# This repo lives on /mnt/c, which is DrvFs 9p: it reports every file
# -rwxrwxrwx and silently discards chmod (CLAUDE.md → "Working from this host").
# So `stat -c %a` here is a constant, not a measurement, and a bundle that
# derived its modes from disk would declare 777 for everything — then the
# installer would either apply that (wrong) or ignore it (and ship a launcher
# binary with no +x, which is the one failure that cannot be reproduced on this
# host at all).  Hence: the caller states the mode, and .list is the authority.
#
# ── Why md5 is a separate file from .list ────────────────────────────────────
#
# F9's caveat: base/version.o re-embeds the build date on every link, so releases
# are not byte-reproducible and the md5 list must be GENERATED per release rather
# than asserted against a known-good set.  Keeping it out of .list means the
# declared modes — which ARE stable — can be diffed between releases without the
# checksums making every line differ.

# rw_bundle_init DIR COMPONENT
#
# Prepare DIR and start (or restart) COMPONENT's manifests.  Truncating here
# rather than appending is deliberate: a re-run of a component's --bundle must
# not leave the previous run's entries behind, or a binary that was renamed stays
# in the manifest and the installer fails verification on a file nobody ships.

# rw_bundle_install_ssh TARGET DIR
#
# Install a staged bundle onto a running device over SSH.  The SSH twin of
# commissioning/commission-offline.sh's install loop, and the capability IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md C12
# and F9 both record as missing.
#
# ── Why this has to exist ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `deploy-all.sh <ip>` BUILDS: it runs each component's build-and-deploy.sh, which
# needs arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc.  The person being delivered to has no toolchain by
# definition — that is what a release bundle is for — so until this existed the
# offline card path was the ONLY way to put binaries on a unit, even for someone
# who already had SSH to it.
#
# ── ⚠️ Modes are DECLARED by the manifest, not carried by the tar ───────────
#
# The stream is unpacked first and every mode applied afterwards from the `.list`.
# It cannot be the other way round: the staging directory usually lives on /mnt/c,
# which reports every file 0777 and discards chmod, so tar preserves a mode that was
# never a measurement.  `.list` is the authority — the same rule rw_bundle_add
# enforces on the write side.
#
# One ssh for the payload rather than one scp per file: 46 files over 46 SSH
# handshakes to a 600 MHz device is minutes of key exchange.
#
# ── How this is testable without a device ───────────────────────────────────
#
# $RW_SSH replaces the ssh command and $RW_BUNDLE_ROOT prefixes every device path,
# both empty in production. Together they let tests/rw_bundle_ssh_test.sh run the
# real function against a directory on this host — the same approach
# rw_provision_online_script's $RW_PROVISION_ROOT takes, and for the same reason:
# an installer whose only test is "it worked on a device once" has no test.
