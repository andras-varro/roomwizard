### END INIT INFO

# Generic init script for RoomWizard.  Reads /opt/roomwizard/default-app to
# determine which executable to launch (e.g. /opt/games/game_selector,
# /opt/vnc_client/vnc_client).
#
# Set the default app with:
#   echo /opt/games/game_selector > /opt/roomwizard/default-app
#
# The system /usr/sbin/watchdog daemon (started by /etc/init.d/watchdog
# via /etc/default/watchdog) feeds /dev/watchdog.  No separate feeder needed.

# Every component deploys its binaries into one of these directories.  A running
# process is one of ours if /proc/<pid>/exe resolves inside one of them.
APP_DIRS="/opt/games /opt/roomwizard /opt/vnc_client"

# Print the PID of every running RoomWizard app, matched on its *executable*.
#
# Matching on a name cannot do this job, for two separate reasons:
#
#   1. This script only knows the *configured* app, which is app_launcher.  The
#      process actually holding /dev/fb0 is usually the app the launcher started
#      - a grandchild whose basename appears nowhere in any config file.  That is
#      why a vnc_client survived a full deploy plus two `stop` calls on
#      2026-08-02, kept the panel at 16bpp and repainted over everything that
#      tried to start after it (B25).
#   2. A parent chooses its child's argv[0].  app_launcher used to pass the
#      manifest's display name, so /proc/<pid>/cmdline read "VNC Client" while
#      the binary was /opt/vnc_client/vnc_client; it passes the exec path now, but
#      nothing stops the next parent from doing it again.  (`comm` survives that
#      either way - the kernel takes it from the file being executed, not from
#      argv[0] - so `killall vnc_client` does in fact match, measured on RW09
#      2026-08-03.  A chosen title is a diagnosis problem, not a kill problem:
#      busybox `ps w` shows only processes with a TTY, so a launcher-started app
#      is invisible to it and /proc is all you have left.)
#
# The exe link is the only identity that is neither chosen by the process nor
# limited to the configured app.
