/**
 * Audio mixer that outputs to /dev/dsp, as a thin ADAPTER over the shared
 * device half in native_apps/common/audio_out.{c,h}.
 *
 * This class owns exactly three things: the ScummVM mixer, the fill callback
 * that hands its bytes to `AudioOut`, and the thread that services the stream.
 * Everything a device needs — the open, the SPEED → FMT → CHANNELS order and the
 * read-back, the ring geometry, the lead, the prefill, the write policy and the
 * underrun accounting — belongs to `audio_out` and must not be reimplemented
 * here.  The next emulator port adapts the same way rather than writing a second
 * OSS backend.  Device facts: ../SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md#34-audio.
