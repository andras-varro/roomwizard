// This file is an ADAPTER, and the point of it is what is NOT here
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// It used to carry its own /dev/dsp open, its own ioctl order, its own ring-size
// query, its own silence prefill, its own EAGAIN retry loop, its own wall-clock
// deadline and its own emergency second write.  All of that is the DEVICE half,
// all of it is now audio_out.{c,h}, and there is one implementation of it because
// more emulator ports are coming: the next one adapts here rather than writing a
// third OSS backend.
//
// ⚠️ Two things about the old code are deliberately NOT carried over:
//
//   - The emergency anti-underrun write.  On a near-empty ring it mixed a second
//     buffer and wrote it while IGNORING the result — a partial write there
//     desynchronises the stream it was trying to rescue, and it was the second
//     write loop in a file that should have none.  `audio_out_service()` targets
//     the lead on every call, which is the same job done once and accounted for;
//     `audio_out_starved()` is where the count lives now.
//
//   - The fixed per-buffer deadline.  audio_out_service() writes a VARIABLE
//     frame count, so advancing a constant deadline against it is two pacing
//     models neither of which bounds the queue (audio_out.h says so about this
//     exact file).  The thread below drops the deadline and paces off the
//     library's own measured interval instead.
//
// ⚠️ Loudness is held IDENTICAL: audio_out_set_shift(&_out, 1) is the old `>>1`,
// and audio_out.h guarantees it is an arithmetic shift rather than a rounding
// multiply for exactly that reason.  ScummVM audio was verified good on the panel
// (King's Quest, Full Throttle) and this change must not be audible.

// ⚠️ **The mixer is built MONO and the device may grant STEREO, so the buffer

// `stereo=false` below, so mixCallback emits one sample per frame whatever the
// device granted. Asking it for `frames * channels` samples and calling that
// done is what the previous version did, and on a device granting 2 it filled
// the buffer with 2*frames MONO samples that the DAC then drained as `frames`
// stereo frames — i.e. playback at double speed, an octave up, not silence and
// with no diagnostic on either side of the boundary. The onboard TWL4030 grants
// 2 as well; this went unnoticed only because nothing read the grant back.
//
// So: mix mono into the front of the buffer, then expand in place from the BACK,
// which is safe because `i * channels >= i` for every i. The buffer arrives
// zeroed and a short fill is legal, but mixCallback always fills what it is
// given, so this returns the whole request either way.
