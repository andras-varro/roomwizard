# rw_ssh_test.sh — regression for lib/rw-ssh.sh, the shared SSH gate
#
# Host-only, no device, no SD card, no root. Run it:
#
#   wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard && ./tests/rw_ssh_test.sh"
#
# ── What each group is for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   A  rw_ssh_classify, the one decision this file turns on: is the target DOWN or
#      is it UP AND REFUSING US? They were one error message across eight call
#      sites, which is why the remedy could never be offered. Pure function, so
#      every case is a recorded stderr string in, one word out.
#   B  rw_ssh_probe against real targets. Three unreachable ones are genuinely
#      unreachable (port 1 on loopback, TEST-NET-1, an .invalid name), and the auth
#      case is a REAL sshd — see below.
#   C  the non-TTY path. ⚠️ This is the group that matters most for regressions,
#      because a gate that blocks here hangs deploy-all.sh with a prompt nobody is
#      watching, and there is no CI to notice.
#   D  the TTY path end to end, under a real pty: no key at all → offer to generate
#      → generate → offer to install → install → RE-PROBE → usable. Only the
#      credential step is faked; the server is real, so "the key was copied and the
#      server still refuses it" is a state this can actually reach.
#   E  the eight call sites are wired to the shared gate, and no raw probe or
#      drifted message survives. ⚠️ THE group that fails against the pre-fix tree —
#      see the count in the header below.
#   F  key generation and, separately, the ownership decision behind it.
#
# ── Why a real sshd, and why it can run here ───────────────────────────────
#
# A genuine `Permission denied` cannot be produced by a stub without writing the
# string the code under test is supposed to recognise — which tests the string
# against itself. So group B starts /usr/sbin/sshd on a high loopback port with its
# own host key and an EMPTY AuthorizedKeysFile. That needs no root: sshd logs
# `setgroups() failed: Operation not permitted` and authenticates the invoking user
# to itself anyway.
#
# ⚠️ It refutes the string this repo had written down. The recorded signature was
# `Permission denied (publickey,password)`; that local sshd says
# `Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)`, because the parenthetical is
# the SERVER's method list. A classifier keyed on it would pass against a device
# (where card-prep.sh sets PasswordAuthentication yes) and call every other server
# "down" — suppressing the offer rather than making a spurious one, so nothing would
# look broken. Case A6 is that negative control.
#
# ⚠️ ssh resolves default identity paths from the passwd entry, NOT from $HOME, so a
# key generated into a fixture $HOME is not offered automatically. Groups B and D
# therefore pass an explicit IdentityFile through the gate's extra-options
# passthrough. That is a fact about this fixture, not about the library: in
# production the operator's home IS their passwd home.
#
# ── Measured against the pre-fix tree and against sabotage ────────────────
#
# tests/measure_ssh_sabotage.sh, which asserts each patch APPLIED before reporting a
# count. Baseline 69; measured 2026-08-07:
#
#   the eight pre-fix call sites, restored from git            17 fail
#   classify: auth keyed on "(publickey,password)"             13 fail
#   the gate reads the stderr from a subshell                  12 fail
#   classify: unknown text falls through to auth               11 fail
#   keygen writes a passphrase                                  3 fail
#   key_owner chowns when not root                               2 fail
#   the re-probe after ssh-copy-id dropped                       2 fail
#   the non-TTY guard removed (rw_ssh_can_prompt always true)     1 fail
#
# ⚠️ Two things that measurement says about this file, both worth keeping visible.
#
# The `key_owner` sabotage FIRST REPORTED "DID NOT APPLY" — its sed used `|` as the
# delimiter and the target line contains `||`, which closes the s/// early. That is
# the exact failure the assert-before-counting rule exists for: with no assert it
# would have printed "0 failed" and read as a suite that cannot see the breakage.
#
# ⚠️ The non-TTY sabotage fails only ONE case, and that is a real limit rather than a
# tight result. With `rw_ssh_can_prompt` forced true, `read` at EOF still fails
# immediately, so the gate falls through the "declined" branch and C4 (returns
# nonzero, does not hang) still passes — only C5's "Not a terminal" wording fails. So
# group C proves the gate does not BLOCK on a closed stdin; it does NOT prove it
# cannot block on a stdin that is open but never written, which is what a CI runner or
# a `yes | ...`-less pipeline actually looks like. The `timeout` wrapper is what would
# catch that, and it has never fired.
#
# What is NOT proven here, and needs root, like tests/commission_offline_test.sh:
# that rw_ssh_keygen's chown actually hands the key to $SUDO_USER. Group F tests the
# DECISION (rw_ssh_key_owner, which takes the euid as an argument so both branches
# are reachable) and that the call site passes the real euid to it.
