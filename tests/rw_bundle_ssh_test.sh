# rw_bundle_ssh_test.sh — regression for rw_bundle_install_ssh, the SSH bundle
#                         installer.
#
# Host-only, no device, no SD card, no root. Run it:
#
#   wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard && ./tests/rw_bundle_ssh_test.sh"
#
# ── How a thing that only exists over SSH is tested without SSH ─────────────
#
# $RW_SSH replaces the ssh command and $RW_BUNDLE_ROOT prefixes every device path,
# both empty in production. The fake RW_SSH here drops its first argument (the
# target) and runs the rest through `sh -c` locally, so the REAL function runs — its
# real tar pipeline, its real chmod loop, its real md5 comparison — against a
# directory on this host.
#
# The alternative was "it worked on a device once", which is not a test. It is also
# not available: the unit at 192.168.50.225 answers but accepts neither of this
# host's keys non-interactively, so the on-device path could not be exercised even
# once at the time this was written.
#
# ⚠️ What this therefore does NOT prove: that ssh itself is invoked correctly (the
# quoting of the remote command as ssh passes it to the remote shell), or anything
# about BusyBox's tar, xargs or md5sum as opposed to GNU's. The remote side here is
# this host's /bin/sh. Those remain untested until someone runs it at a device.
#
# ── Modes ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The fixture is built under $(mktemp -d) — WSL's own filesystem, which honours
# chmod. On /mnt/c it would not, and the +x case would pass for the wrong reason.
#
# ── Measured against deliberately broken copies ────────────────────────────
#
# Re-run with tests/measure_bundle_ssh_sabotage.sh, which asserts each patch APPLIED
# before reporting a count. Out of 23, measured 2026-08-06:
#
#   the chmod loop dropped, i.e. modes taken from the tar        9 fail
#   rw_bundle_check skipped                                     3 fail
#   the +x check removed                                        2 fail
#   a failed transfer no longer fatal                           2 fail
#   md5 mismatch no longer reported                             1 fail
#   the owner digit read from the end instead of by position     1 fail
#
# ⚠️ Two of those reported ZERO at first. The transfer one was a bad sabotage —
# it appended `; true` to an echo while the `return 1` on the next line still ran.
# The owner-digit one was a real gap: D1/D2 assert that an 0700 entry installs
# cleanly, which is true under both readings, and even after D3 was added it stayed
# green because app_launcher was still 0755 and got caught either way. It needed
# EVERY executable entry at 0700. Both are the same lesson as the first four
# sabotages, which all reported 22/0 because none of the patterns had matched at all.
#
# ── Group E, measured against the pre-change tree ────────────────────────────
#
# Group E is about the provenance stamp, and it was measured against the tree that
# had the defect — a whole-tree deploy cleared the stamp and a single component's
# build-and-deploy.sh did not:
#
#   the four component scripts + deploy-all.sh restored to their
#   pre-change state, current lib/rw-bundle.sh                   5 fail (32/5/37)
#   lib/rw-bundle.sh alone restored                              the suite DIES
#
# ⚠️ The second row is a result, not a count, and that is the limit of this control.
# With no $RW_BUNDLE_STAMP defined, `set -u` aborts the run at E1 — so the suite
# exits nonzero and prints no summary line at all. E7 and E8 are the cases that
# would have passed vacuously had it kept going: a rw_bundle_clear_stamp that does
# not exist returns 127, which both of them read as the refusal they are asserting.
# They are worth keeping (they falsify a function that returns 0 unconditionally,
# which E3 alone does not), but do not read them as evidence the function exists —
# E1/E2, which need it to have removed a file, are what do that.
