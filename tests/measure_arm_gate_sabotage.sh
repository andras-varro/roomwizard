# measure_arm_gate_sabotage.sh — re-measure tests/check_arm_safe_test.sh against
# deliberately broken copies of the gate, and print the counts its header claims.
#
# There is no CI, so a suite that has only ever been seen passing is not evidence
# that it can fail. This drives the REAL suite (via RW_GATE) against each sabotage;
# it never restates an assertion, because a harness that re-implements what it
# checks can repair the very defect it was written to catch.
#
# ⚠️ Every sabotage is asserted APPLIED before its count is believed. A sed pattern
# that fails to match leaves the file correct, the suite passes, and "0 failed"
# reads exactly like "this sabotage is undetectable".
#
# Host-only: no device, no card, no root. Needs the ARM cross toolchain.
