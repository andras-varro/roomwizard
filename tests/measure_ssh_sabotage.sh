# sabotages that all reported 22/0 for that reason.

# The first case is not a sabotage but the PRE-FIX TREE: the eight call sites as they
# were before F16, restored from git. That is the "write the failing version first"
# measurement — a wiring check that has only ever been seen passing is not evidence it
