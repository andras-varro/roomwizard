# Regression for native_apps/check-arm-safe.sh — the SIGILL gate (IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md C9).
#
# Host-only: no device, no card, no root. Needs the ARM cross toolchain, which is
# measured present in this WSL (IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md F11). A missing toolchain is a
# REFUSAL, not a pass — a gate test that skips itself reports "0 failed" and is
# indistinguishable from a suite that cannot detect the breakage.
#
# The property under test: the gate is sound only on a binary that still has its
# symbol table. These binaries are Thumb-2 and objdump needs the symbol table to
# know that; stripped, it falls back to 32-bit ARM and re-reads the same bytes as
# ARM words, manufacturing sdiv/udiv out of ordinary Thumb code. So a hit in a
# stripped binary must never be counted as a failure — and must never be silently
# passed either, which is the same bug from the other side.
#
# Run:  bash tests/check_arm_safe_test.sh
