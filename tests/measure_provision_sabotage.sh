# ── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A one-of-eight install defect shipped past 94 passing cases in rw_provision_test.sh:
# `rw_provision_online_script` installed the first file of the eight and silently
# dropped the rest. Group F is the answer,
# and a group that has only ever been seen passing is not evidence that it can
# fail — which is exactly the property that defect disproved about the suite it was added
# to. So every case below breaks one thing and names which assertions notice.
#
# ⚠️ It stages ONE FILE, via $RW_PROVISION_LIB. `cp -a` of a directory out of
# /mnt/c into WSL /tmp can exceed a 300 s budget and looks indistinguishable from a
# hung suite (that is measured, not feared). Sabotage 5 is the exception: it patches
# the SUITE, so it stages a copy of it under tests/ — the suite resolves REPO_DIR
# from its own location, so a copy in /tmp would measure nothing.
#
# ⚠️ Every sabotage is asserted APPLIED before its count is believed, in two
# independent ways: the staged file must differ from the shipped one, AND the
# intended text must be present. A sed that stops matching leaves the file correct,
# the suite passes, and "0 failed" reads exactly like "this sabotage is
# undetectable". Restoring is a `cp` from the shipped file — never `git checkout`,
# which would revert the uncommitted fix this harness is measuring.
#
# ── What each sabotage is ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1  the plan read on stdin, not fd 3      B28 ITSELF. The first ssh consumes the
#                                            rest of the plan and one file is copied
#   2  the missing-source check deleted      an install whose device-files/ source
#                                            was renamed silently copies nothing and
#                                            the executor blames the device
#   3  the mkdir -p dropped                  /etc/sysctl.d, /opt/roomwizard and
#                                            /usr/local/bin do not exist on a vendor
#                                            unit, so scp fails on three of eight
#   4  the summary truncated to three types  B28's own header: "35 action(s) — 8
#                                            install, 9 link, 10 unlink" accounted
#                                            for 27, hiding four verbs
#   5  the suite's stub ssh stops reading     a control on the HARNESS, not the lib:
#      its stdin                              if the stub is unfaithful, F1 cannot
#                                             reproduce B28 and all of F is vacuous
#
# ── Measured 2026-08-09, ~2 min for the whole run ────────────────────────────
#
# Counts are minimums, not equalities — a case added later may raise one. Which
# assertions fail matters more than how many, so they are named.
#
#   baseline                                    109 passed,  0 failed
#   1 the plan on stdin, not fd 3               102 passed,  7 failed
#       F2 F3 F4 F5 F7 F8 F12 — 1 of 8 copied, so the function's own got-vs-want
#                     guard returns 1 (F2) and every downstream count is short
#   2 the missing-source refusal deleted        108 passed,  1 failed
#       F10         — ⚠️ ONE case, and not the obvious one. "It returned non-zero"
#                     still passes, because scp fails on a missing source anyway;
#                     what changes is that a mkdir ran on the device first
#   3 the mkdir -p dropped                      102 passed,  7 failed
#       F2 F3 F4 F5 F7 F8 F12 — the same set as sabotage 1. Indistinguishable by
#                     count AND by name, which is honest: both mean "the copy step
#                     does not copy". F7/F8 are what separate the causes, by naming
#                     the directories, and they are in both sets
#   4 the summary truncated to 3 types          108 passed,  1 failed
#       F14         — F13 still passes: the TOTAL was always right, it was the
#                     breakdown that accounted for 27 of 35
#   5 control: the stub ssh stops reading stdin 108 passed,  1 failed
#       F1 ONLY     — required to be exactly F1. An unfaithful stub must break the
#                     one case whose job is to prove the stub, and nothing else
#
# F6 passes under sabotages 1 and 3, deliberately: it compares the bytes of the
# files that DID arrive, and one correct file is still one correct file. F5 is the
# case that counts the absent ones.
