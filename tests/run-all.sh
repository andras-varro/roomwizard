# run-all.sh — the host gate: every test this repo can run without a device.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Until this script, nothing ran more than one suite.  The twelve shell
#   suites in tests/ each had to be invoked by hand, the host-gcc
#   regressions in native_apps/tests/ carried their build line in a comment
#   and nothing anywhere executed them, and no build or deploy path ran any
#   of them.  A change could reach a device having been graded by nobody.
#
# WHAT IT RUNS  (three phases, one data table each — see the tables below)
#   1. shell suites        tests/*_test.sh plus doc_check.sh
#   2. host C regressions  native_apps/tests/*_test.c, host gcc, no device
#   3. shellcheck          every tracked *.sh, in two tiers (see PHASE 3)
#
# MEASURED COST, this host, 2026-09-08, warm cache:
#   phase 1  185 s   — rw_ssh_test.sh alone is 121 s (it starts a real sshd
#                      and probes TEST-NET-1, so most of that is timeouts);
#                      doc_check.sh 36 s; the other ten total 28 s
#   phase 2   14 s   — ten builds plus ten runs
#   phase 3   10 s
#   Total    ~3.5 min, which is less than one ScummVM rebuild.
#
# SCOPE
#   --scope=deploy  omits doc_check.sh, which grades documentation and cannot
#                   affect a deployed byte.  This is what deploy-all.sh runs.
#   --scope=all     everything.  The default, and what release.sh runs, since
#                   a release bundle ships the documentation too.
#
# EXIT
#   0  every subject passed
#   1  a subject FAILED — do not deploy
#   2  HARNESS ERROR: the gate could not judge.  Never used for "a test
#      failed".  Raised when a subject list comes back empty, when a
#      *_test.c on disk is in neither table, when a required tool is absent,
#      or when a suite itself exits 2.
#
# A SKIP IS NOT A PASS.  commission_offline_test.sh exits 0 when it cannot
# get root, and a runner that grades on exit status alone would report that
# as green having tested nothing.  Skips are counted and named separately,
# and the summary prints the command that would cover them.
#
# NEGATIVE CONTROLS: --self-test.  Each drives this script and asserts the exit
# code it must produce; the run itself says how many there are.  Every one has
# been seen to fire, and two of them first passed VACUOUSLY — see the notes at
# controls 5 and 7.  The four overrides they use (RW_SUITE_DIR, RW_CTEST_DIR,
# RW_SC_BASELINE, RW_SC_FILES) exist for that and nothing else.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE
#   Anything that needs the panel.  No screen is drawn, no touch is read, no
#   sound is heard, and no binary here is the ARM binary that ships.  It
#   cannot tell you an app looks right; it can only tell you the logic under
#   it still computes what it used to.  The first-screen smoke harness that
#   would close part of that gap needs a device and is not in this file.
#
# Run it:  bash tests/run-all.sh            (from anywhere)
#          bash tests/run-all.sh --list     (the subject tables, no run)
#          bash tests/run-all.sh --self-test

        # "the RIFF pad byte is skipped", "comments and blanks are skipped" —
        # which understates coverage exactly as badly as absorbing a real skip
        # overstates it.  Nor can a verdict line be used as the guard the way

# ── PHASE 3: shellcheck ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Two tiers, because the repo carries a backlog of pre-existing findings that are
# not this gate's to fix, and a gate that demanded zero would simply be disabled.
# ⚠️ The size of that backlog is NOT written here: tests/shellcheck-baseline.txt is
# its one home, and a copy in prose goes stale silently.  It read "319" while the
# baseline summed to 316 — measure with awk '{s+=$3} END{print s, NR}' on the file.
#
#   TIER 1, a hard zero:  every finding at error: severity, plus every SC11xx
#     code.  SC11xx is the family that means shellcheck could not do its job
#     — and one of them, SC1124, is measured to make the tool exit 1 having
#     analysed NOTHING in that file, which reads exactly like a clean run
#     that found one small problem.  A voided analysis must never be a pass.
#
#   TIER 2, a ratchet:  tests/shellcheck-baseline.txt records one row per
#     (file, code) with its current count.  A count going UP, or a new
#     (file, code) pair, FAILS.  A count going down passes and says so.  The
#     backlog stays visible as open work instead of being suppressed with
#     disable= directives in shipped source, which is also how this gate
#     avoids adding SC1124 risk of its own.
