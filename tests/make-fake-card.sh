# make-fake-card.sh — build a synthetic MOUNTED card of OUR root image under $1.

# NOT a repo tool: a scratch fixture builder for exercising commissioning/commission-offline.sh
# without a card and without a device. It mirrors what rootfs/make-card-image.sh hands that
# script: p6 is our Buildroot root (marker etc/roomwizard-rootfs, the rcS.d/rc5.d links and
# the key-only sshd_config that rootfs/board/roomwizard/{post-build.sh,overlay} produce),
# p2/p3/p5 are empty ext4 trees. There is no vendor software anywhere in it. It is
# committed because the alternative is retyping it, and because the one thing it must get
# right — REAL SYMLINKS in rc*.d — is exactly what partitions/ and partitions.new/ lost on
# the way through Windows (CLAUDE.md → "Working from this host").
