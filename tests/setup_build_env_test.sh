# Regression for ../setup-build-env.sh — the one home for host build prerequisites.
#
# Host-only: no device, no card, no root, and NOTHING IS EVER INSTALLED. The one
# destructive thing the script under test can do is `sudo apt-get install`, so this suite
# shims `sudo` onto PATH and asserts on the argv it recorded. That is deliberately a
# tripwire rather than an exit-status check: it makes the dangerous input safe to run for
# real, so the "print the exact command before running it" promise is measured against what
# the process was actually handed, not against what the script printed.
#
# ⚠️ What this suite CANNOT see, both of which under-report:
#   - File modes. /mnt/c is DrvFs 9p and reports every file executable, so a missing +x on
#     setup-build-env.sh can neither fire nor be demonstrated from this host.
#   - A real `apt-get install`. Whether the package NAMES resolve on a live archive is not
#     checked here; the suite checks that the right names reach the right command line.
#
# Run:  bash tests/setup_build_env_test.sh
