# rw_release_test.sh — regression for release.sh: the `rm -rf "$OUT"` guard and
#                      the git provenance the bundle's NOTICE rests on.
#
# Host-only, no device, no card, no root, no network, no `gh`. Run it:
#
#   wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard && ./tests/rw_release_test.sh"
#
# ── Why the script is COPIED and never sourced ──────────────────────────────
#
# release.sh defines its own ok()/info()/warn()/err(), and err() exits. Sourcing
# it would end this suite on the first refusal and overwrite the helpers below.
# So every case runs the shipped file as a program — in a temp tree, because
# SCRIPT_DIR comes from $0 and the script cd's there and sources lib/rw-bundle.sh
# and lib/rw-release.sh under `set -e` BEFORE it parses a single argument. A copy
# of the bare script dies before reading `--out`.
#
# ── Why `rm` is replaced by a tripwire ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The guard's whole job is to refuse before the `rm -rf`. Asserting "it exited
# non-zero" cannot see the difference between a refusal and a script that wiped
# the directory and then failed for some later reason — and the defect this suite
# exists for accepted `--out /usr` straight into that `rm -rf`. So group A puts a
# fake `rm` first on PATH: it records its argv and exits 1, which aborts
# release.sh at its own `set -e`. An empty log is the assertion. That is also what
# makes a root spelling safe to exercise against a PRE-FIX copy of the script on
# this host — the guard being measured is exactly the one that would let / through.
#
# The shipped script is not modified to make this work: `rm -rf "$OUT"` is the
# only `rm` in it (measured), so the shim is a precise tripwire and nothing else.
#
# ── What each group is for ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   A  the --out guard. Every refusal asserted three ways: non-zero exit, an empty
#      tripwire log, and the message. Plus the decoy file survives — "it exited
#      non-zero" is not the claim, "it did not delete that" is.
#   B  the two paths that must be ACCEPTED, which is the half a guard suite
#      normally cannot reach: an empty directory and a re-stage over a real
#      bundle. Both fall through into the four-component ARM build loop, so this
#      group runs against a STUB component (see the hole named below). It ends in
#      a floor — a bundle that staged nothing would pass every other case here.
#   C  GIT_DIRTY, which is what the publish preflight refuses on and what
#      bundle.info records. C1 and C4 are the controls: the check must be able to
#      say "clean", or C2/C3 pass against a check hardwired to say "dirty".
#
# ── Seen failing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `tests/measure_release_sabotage.sh` is the sweep, and every case in it produces
# failures. Measured 2026-09-07, against a green baseline of 40:
#
#   the pre-fix release.sh entire (git show ba7eded^)   11 failed
#   --out normalisation dropped                          3 failed  cases A3/A4/A5
#   the ownership check dropped                          4 failed  cases A6/A7/A10/A13
#   the quoted-glob guard restored                       30 failed
#   the --cached dirty check dropped                     2 failed  cases C3/C5
#   the post-build --cached half dropped                 1 failed  case C5 alone
#   release.sh replaced by `exit 1`                     32 failed
#   release.sh replaced by `exit 0`                     27 failed
#
# The last two are controls on THIS file rather than on release.sh. `exit 1`
# refuses everything, so a suite asserting only "it failed" would go green on it;
# `exit 0` deletes nothing and succeeds, so a suite reading only the exit status
# would go green on that. Both must fail wholesale, and do.
#
# ⚠️ Note what the sweep does NOT move: A11/A12/A14, the "and the decoy's file is
# still there" cases, keep passing under the ownership-check sabotage. The
# tripwire is why — it aborts the script in place of the `rm -rf`, so the decoy
# survives a guard that has been removed entirely. Those cases witness that the
# tripwire's own claim is true, not that the guard refused; the case above each of
# them is what carries the refusal.
#
# ── The hole, named ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Group B's acceptance is asserted against a stub component script, never against
# a real four-component ARM build. release.sh has no --no-build flag, so nothing
# here can see whether native_apps, vnc_client, scummvm-roomwizard and usb_host
# actually honour `--bundle <dir>`; what it sees is that release.sh calls them
# with exactly those two arguments and consumes the bundle they leave behind.
