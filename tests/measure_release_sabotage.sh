# In a FILE and not in argv, for the reason measure_sabotage.sh gives: a pattern
# containing `$`, `[` or a tab does not survive being quoted through
# `wsl.exe -e bash -lc "..."`, and a sabotage that fails to apply reports "0
# failed" — which reads exactly like a suite that cannot detect the breakage.
#
# ⚠️ Restore is a `cp` from a copy taken up front, never `git checkout`: the fix
# being measured is uncommitted while this runs, and a git restore would destroy it.
#
# ⚠️ Case 1 is the real pre-fix tree (`git show ba7eded^:release.sh`) and its count
# includes failures that are NOT about the guard — that revision predates the
# hoisted publish preflight and the provenance stamp, so group B's structural
# cases fail too. The targeted cases below are what attribute the count.
#
# Safe to run: the suite replaces `rm` with a tripwire for every guard case, so a
# sabotaged guard that accepts `--out /` logs the path and dies instead of running.
