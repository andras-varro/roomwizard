# Sabotage sweep for tests/setup_build_env_test.sh.
#
# There is no CI, so a suite that has only ever been seen passing is not evidence that it
# can fail. This breaks setup-build-env.sh in five specific ways and asserts that the suite
# notices each one, naming the cases that must go red. A sabotage that produces "0 failed"
# is a hole in the suite, not a clean bill.
#
# ⚠️ Nothing is restored with git. The working tree may hold an uncommitted fix that a
# `git checkout` would destroy; every sabotage here is applied to a COPY under /tmp and the
# original is never written.
#
# ⚠️ The sed patterns live in this file rather than in argv, because a pattern containing
# `\t` does not survive `wsl.exe -e bash -lc` quoting and one containing `||` silently
# matches nothing. Each sabotage verifies its own patch APPLIED before drawing a conclusion
# — a sed that matched nothing reports "not caught" for the wrong reason, which is
# indistinguishable from a suite that cannot detect the breakage.
#

# ── 1. the bug this suite was written around ────────────────────────────────
# Rename the selection array back to GROUPS, which bash owns: the assignment is silently
# refused and the selection becomes the invoking user's numeric group IDs. Nothing matches
# the table. This is the real defect the first draft shipped with.
sabotage "SEL_GROUPS renamed back to GROUPS (a bash special variable)" \
    's/\bSEL_GROUPS\b/GROUPS/g' \
    "1a-1e (the probe loop selects nothing)"

# ── 2. the zero-subjects guard ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Without it, a selection matching nothing prints "0 of 0 present, 0 missing" and exits 0 —
# a green gate over a host it never looked at. This is what made sabotage 1 survivable.

# ── 3. installing without being asked ───────────────────────────────────────
# The TTY test is what keeps a blocking prompt out of release.sh and deploy-all.sh.
# ⚠️ Forcing it true does NOT reach sudo: `read` against /dev/null returns empty, which
# falls into the decline branch, so the exit status and the tripwire both stay correct and
# only the explanatory line goes missing. That is why sabotage 6 exists — this one alone
# would leave case 4c, the tripwire, unswept.
sabotage "the non-TTY branch takes the interactive path" \
    's/^    elif \[ -t 0 \]; then$/    elif true; then/' \
    "4b only (the decline branch still refuses, so 4a and 4c stay green)"

# ── 4. printing one command and running another ─────────────────────────────
# The promise is that the operator SEES what runs. Drop a package from the printed line
# only: every other case still passes, and 5c is the one that notices.

    's|^    echo "  sudo apt-get install -y \${MISSING\[\*\]}"$|    echo "  sudo apt-get install -y ${MISSING[0]}"|' \
    "5c (printed and executed differ)"

# ── 5. guessing at a non-Debian host ────────────────────────────────────────
# apt-only with a clean refusal is deliberate: a wrong package manager that half-succeeds
# is worse than a refusal naming the set.
sabotage "the apt-get check removed, so a non-Debian host is guessed at" \
    's/^    if ! command -v apt-get >\/dev\/null 2>&1; then$/    if false; then/' \
    "6a-6b (no refusal on a host without apt-get)"

# ── 6. the tripwire's own control ───────────────────────────────────────────
# ⚠️ Case 4c asserts sudo was NEVER called. An assertion that something did not happen
# passes for free in any run where the code path is simply unreachable — so unless some
# sabotage actually reaches sudo unbidden, 4c is a vacuous pass. Defaulting DO_INSTALL to 1
# is that sabotage: it installs with no TTY and no flag, and 4c is what notices.

# than the one asked for.
