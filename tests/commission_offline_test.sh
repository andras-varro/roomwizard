# commission_offline_test.sh — regression for commissioning/commission-offline.sh's VERIFY pass

# tests/make-fake-card.sh, mounted nowhere and handed over with --base.
#
#   wsl.exe -u root -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard && tests/commission_offline_test.sh"
#
# Needs root (or passwordless sudo), because commissioning/card-prep.sh writes
# through sudo. ⚠️ Under a plain `wsl.exe -e bash -lc` this suite stalls on
# `sudo: a password is required` at card-prep.sh's /etc/shadow write and reports no
# useful verdict — `-u root` above is what sidesteps it, not a convenience.
# Needs a staged bundle: ./release.sh --stage-only [--component
# native_apps] leaves one in build/release.
#
# ── Why every case here is a SABOTAGE ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The verify pass is eight checks that all report success on a good install, and a
# check that cannot fail is decoration. So each case breaks exactly one thing and
# asserts that (a) the right check fires and (b) the tool exits non-zero. The
# happy path is case 1 and is the control for all of them.
#
# Section 4 is the one exception and is the mirror image: the --no-usb skip must
# exit ZERO and still say which flag skipped it, so it uses expect_says rather
# than expect_fires; so is section 5's --unattended success case, beside its three
# refusals. Section 0 is neither — it is the structural check on the fixture tree
# itself.
#
# The sabotages run against COPIES — a copy of the bundle, and a copy of just the
# scripts commissioning/commission-offline.sh reads (not the repo, which carries 4 GB of card
# images). SCRIPT_DIR is derived from the script's own location, so a copied tree
# is a genuinely different installation.
#
# ⚠️ One thing is NOT controlled here, deliberately: a binary that really does
# contain an sdiv. This host's compiler will not emit one for Cortex-A8, so there
# is no way to build the positive case without hand-assembling it —
# native_apps/check-arm-safe.sh carries that reasoning and SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md#61-cortex-a8-has-no-hardware-integer-divide
# the two ways to get a wrong answer out of the gate. What IS controlled is both
# ways the gate can lie by omission: a bundle with zero ARM binaries (2g) and a
# host with no arm objdump (2j, 2k), where the gate must REFUSE rather than pass.
