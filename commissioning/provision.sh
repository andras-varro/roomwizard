# commissioning/provision.sh — UPDATE a unit that runs our own root filesystem, over SSH
#
# Re-runnable. It installs the files and links device-files/provision-rules.conf
# declares (boot scripts, the app launcher's init service, audio + time-sync, mDNS,
# USB host mode, Bluetooth, sysctl), applies the sysctl settings,
# and reboots. It deletes no software: the unit's root is ours, not the vendor's.
#
# Usage:
#   ./commissioning/provision.sh <target>                 # backup, update, reboot
#   ./commissioning/provision.sh <target> --dry-run       # print the provision plan; change nothing
#   ./commissioning/provision.sh <target> --status        # show device status only (read-only)
#   ./commissioning/provision.sh <target> --hostname rw09 # set the host name only, no reboot
#
# <target> is an IPv4 address or a host name — `rw09.local` works once mDNS is
# enabled (this script does that) and the unit has a unique name (--hostname).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - A unit running our root image (rootfs/), reachable by SSH as root
#
# What it does:
#   0. Backs the unit's per-unit state up to this host (commissioning/backup.sh)
#      BEFORE the first write; a failed backup aborts the run.
#   1. Installs the provision plan: device-files/roomwizard-app as
#      /etc/init.d/roomwizard-app, the audio-enable + time-sync boot scripts, avahi
#      (mDNS), the USB host-mode scripts and their boot links (--no-usb skips), the
#      Bluetooth boot script and dbus policy (--no-bluetooth skips)
#   2. Applies kernel/sysctl security settings (ASLR, no ip_forward, etc.)
#   3. Reboots the device
#
# NOTE: No iptables firewall — the kernel has CONFIG_NETFILTER=y but no ip_tables
# module was built, and there is no package manager to add one.
# Network security relies on: SSH hardening + sysctl + disabling services.
#
# After this, deploy a project and set it as the default app:
#   cd native_apps && ./build-and-deploy.sh <ip> set-default
#   cd vnc_client   && ./build-and-deploy.sh <ip> set-default

# Source-path directive: resolves the source= hints below against this script's directory.

# What is INSTALLED is DATA in one file, device-files/provision-rules.conf, shared
# with commissioning/commission-offline.sh so that the live and offline passes cannot
# drift. lib/rw-provision.sh is the parser and the plan compiler; the executors
# differ ("/" is the correct prefix on a device and a refused one offline, and on
# this path the work happens on the far side of an ssh pipe), but there is one
