# commissioning/restore.sh — write a commissioning/backup.sh archive back to a unit.
#
# Usage: commissioning/restore.sh <ip|host> <backup.tar.gz> [--dry-run]
#
# Refused before anything touches the unit: an archive that does not list, holds
# an absolute or '..' path, or holds anything outside lib/rw-state.sh's BACKUP set
# (rw_state_backup_foreign) — so a hand-built archive cannot write /etc/shadow.
#
# Then, on the unit: stop the app through /etc/init.d/roomwizard-app stop (the one
# implementation of "stop what is running"; never a killall), extract over / with
# BusyBox tar -o (--no-same-owner: every file lands root-owned, which is what the
# unit runs as; one captured default-app was 1000/1000), put the modes sshd insists
# on back (/home/root/.ssh 700, authorized_keys 600, host private keys 600), and
# start the app again.
#
# What it does not do: restart sshd, bluetoothd or the network. A restored host
# key, pairing, host name or time zone takes effect at the next reboot, and the
# receipt says so. --dry-run is read-only on the unit: it says which paths would be
# overwritten and which created.
# Source-path directive: resolves the source= hints below against this script's directory.

Usage: commissioning/restore.sh <ip|host> <backup.tar.gz> [--dry-run]

Writes a commissioning/backup.sh archive back to the unit: stops the app, extracts
over / (owners not restored), fixes SSH modes, starts the app. Only paths in the
BACKUP set of lib/rw-state.sh are accepted.

  --dry-run    list what would be written (overwrite / new); change nothing
