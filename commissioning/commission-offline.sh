# commissioning/commission-offline.sh — the IMAGE STEP: install a release bundle and the
#                         provision plan into a card's partitions, mounted by the caller.
#
# The only caller is rootfs/make-card-image.sh --bundle, which loop-mounts the four
# partitions of a card IMAGE it is building (our own Buildroot root on p6, marker
# etc/roomwizard-rootfs) and hands them over with --base. Nothing here reads a
# terminal, scans a disk or mounts anything; it needs no root of its own and no network.
# A unit already in service is updated online with commissioning/provision.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   ./commissioning/commission-offline.sh --bundle <file.tar.gz|dir> --base <dir> [options]
#   ./commissioning/commission-offline.sh --bundle <b> --base <dir> --dry-run
#
#   --bundle <path>     A release tarball from `./release.sh --stage-only`, or a staged
#                       bundle directory. THE source of binaries: this host has no
#                       toolchain to fall back on.
#   --base <dir>        REQUIRED. The card, already mounted as <dir>/{root,data,log,backup}.
#   --dry-run           Print every resolved absolute path and change nothing.
#   --no-<group>        Skip one group of the provision plan (see --help).
#   --arm-check=skip    Proceed with UNVERIFIED binaries when the ARM objdump is
#                       absent. Read what it prints before you use it.
#
# REFUSED, by name and with a non-zero exit, because the card-update path they belonged to
# is gone and a flag accepted and ignored reads as a choice honoured: --no-clean,
# --keep-<group>, --delete-factory, --unattended, --disk, --release, --ssh-auth=*,
# --sshd-only.

# ── What this script does NOT reimplement ──────────────────────────────────

#
#   which mount is which       lib/rw-identify.sh, by content and by POSITION, never
#                              by UUID. p1 is not reachable from there at all.
#   what to install            device-files/provision-rules.conf — the boot scripts,
#                              the rc*.d links and the config fix-ups, shared with
#                              commissioning/provision.sh so the two cannot drift.

Usage: $0 --bundle <file.tar.gz|dir> --base <dir> [options]

The image step of rootfs/make-card-image.sh --bundle. Asks nothing, mounts nothing,
needs no network. A unit in service is updated with commissioning/provision.sh.

  --bundle <path>    Release tarball or staged bundle directory (REQUIRED)
  --base <dir>       The card, already mounted as <dir>/{root,data,log,backup}
                     (REQUIRED). p6 must carry our root's marker, etc/roomwizard-rootfs.
  --dry-run          Resolve and print everything, change nothing.
  --no-<group>       Skip one group of the provision plan. Groups:
                     $(rw_provision_optional_groups)
                     --no-mdns leaves <name>.local unresolvable. The reason for each
                     is in device-files/provision-rules.conf.
  --arm-check=skip   Install binaries this host cannot verify. Say why to
                     yourself first; the message it replaces explains the risk.
  --help

Refused with an error, being retired with the card-update path: --no-clean,
--keep-<group>, --delete-factory, --unattended, --disk, --release, --ssh-auth=*,
--sshd-only.
