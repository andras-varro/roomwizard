# commissioning/set-hostname.sh — set a RoomWizard's host name, in /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts
#                   AND /etc/dhclient.conf
#
# ONE implementation, called from two places with different connection models:
#
#   card-prep.sh                offline, against a mounted card:
#                                 sudo ./commissioning/set-hostname.sh NAME /mnt/rw
#   provision.sh --hostname     over SSH, against the live root:
#                                 ./commissioning/set-hostname.sh NAME
#
# It lives in its own file rather than in either caller because the two paths
# would otherwise carry the same 30 lines of /etc/hosts rewriting and drift
# apart; and because a standalone script can be exercised on the host against a
# copy of a real vendor rootfs, with no SD card and no device.
#
# Why /etc/hosts is rewritten and not just /etc/hostname: the vendor image maps
# the device's OWN host name, on a non-loopback line, to an external address that
# is unreachable from anywhere these units are used. That mapping is baked into
# the image, so it is the same on every unit cloned from it. Setting
# /etc/hostname alone leaves it in place, and anything resolving its own name
# still gets the wrong answer. See IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md D7.
#
# Why /etc/dhclient.conf too: it is the THIRD place the name is stored, and the
# one a DHCP server — and therefore a router's device list — actually reads.
# Measured on a unit in service on 2026-08-05: renamed months earlier, and still
# announcing `send host-name "RW09";`. Nothing in this repo wrote that file until
# now (IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md D7b item 3).
#
# Usage: commissioning/set-hostname.sh NAME [ROOTFS]
#   NAME    RFC-1123 single label. No dots — mDNS appends .local itself, and a
#           dotted name in /etc/hosts is part of what made the shipped mapping
#           confusing to read.
#   ROOTFS  prefix to edit under. Empty or absent means the live root, in which
#           case the running kernel's name is set too.
#
# POSIX sh only, no bashisms: this runs under BusyBox ash on the device.
