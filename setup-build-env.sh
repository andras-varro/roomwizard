# setup-build-env.sh — the one home for this repo's HOST build prerequisites.
#
# Two delivery modes, and only one of them has a toolchain. DELIVERY: someone clones the
# repo, puts a card in a reader, answers a few questions, puts the card back, and the
# device works — they may never build anything, and commissioning/commission-offline.sh
# serves them. DEVELOPMENT: we build and deploy onto an already-clean device, which is
# what deploy-all.sh does. This script exists to make the second reachable on a fresh
# machine, from one package set in one place.
#
# ⚠️ It installs HOST packages only. The CROSS-COMPILED dependencies already install
# themselves and are deliberately not listed here: scummvm-roomwizard/build-and-deploy.sh's
# build_arm_deps fetches and builds zlib + libpng into scummvm-roomwizard/arm-deps/, and
# vnc_client/build-deps.sh does zlib / libjpeg-turbo / LibVNCServer into vnc_client/deps/.
# Both are idempotent and neither needs sudo, so neither belongs in an apt line.
#
# ⚠️ THE SHELL YOU RUN THIS IN IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT. Every tool probed below is
# absent from Git Bash and present in WSL, so a sweep run in the wrong shell reports a host
# with no toolchain at all — a reading that has already been mistaken for a hard blocker on
# all building. This script refuses to run outside a Linux shell rather than print that.
#
# Run:  wsl.exe -e bash -lc "cd /mnt/c/work/roomwizard && ./setup-build-env.sh"

Usage: ./setup-build-env.sh [--install-deps] [--scummvm] [--group <g>]...

Reports which host build prerequisites are missing, and offers to install them.
Run it from WSL (or any Linux shell); it refuses under Git Bash, where every one
of these tools is absent and the report would be about the shell, not the host.

  (no flags)       Probe and report. Offers to install only if stdin is a TTY.
  --install-deps   Install without asking. For scripted use, or a fresh clone.
  --scummvm        Also set up the upstream ScummVM tree, which is not an apt
                   package: clone it, check out branch-2-8, and restore our
                   backend files. Needed only to build scummvm-roomwizard.
  --group <g>      Probe only these groups; repeatable. Default: all four.
                     core    every component needs these
                     decode  python3 + PIL, for fb565_to_png.py screenshots
                     kmod    usb_host kernel modules only
                     check   shellcheck, for the host suites and the pre-deploy gate
  -h, --help       This text.

Exit 0 = every selected prerequisite is present. 1 = something is still missing.
2 = refused (wrong shell, bad argument, or not a Debian/Ubuntu host).

The measured inventory of this project's dev host, and the shell each claim was
measured in, live in COMMISSIONING.md -> "The dev host".
